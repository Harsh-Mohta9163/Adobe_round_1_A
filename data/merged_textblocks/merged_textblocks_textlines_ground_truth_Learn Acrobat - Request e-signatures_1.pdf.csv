"Note: See also Export security settings.https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/setting-security-policies-pdfs.html#exportsecuritysettings Add a timestamp to certificate-based signatures You can include the date and time you signed the document as part of your certificate-based signature. Timestamps are easier to verify when they are associated with a trusted timestamp authority certificate. A timestamp helps to establish when you signed the document and reduces the chances of an invalid signature. You can obtain a timestamp from a third-party timestamp authority or the certificate authority that issued your digital ID. Timestamps appear in the signature field and in the Signature Properties dialog box. If a timestamp server is configured, the timestamp appears in the Date/Time tab of the Signature Properties dialog box. If no timestamp server is configured, the signatures field displays the local time of the computer at the moment of signing. Note: If you did not embed a timestamp when you signed the document, you can add one later to your signature. See Establish long-term signature validation. A timestamp appliedhttps://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/validating-digital-signatures.html#establishlongtermsignaturevalidation after signing a document uses the time provided by the timestamp server. Configure a timestamp server To configure a timestamp server, you need the server name and the URL, which you can obtain from an administrator or a security settings file. If you have a security settings file, install it and don’t use the following instructions for configuring a server. Ensure that you obtained the security settings file from a trusted source. Don’t install it without checking with your system administration or IT department.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",29,12.6,247,0,0.757,0.15294117647058825,0.10869565217391304,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,
