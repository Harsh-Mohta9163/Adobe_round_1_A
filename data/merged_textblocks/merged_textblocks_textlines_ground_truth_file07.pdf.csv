"Interleaving, a learning technique which involves practicing on multiple skills in parallel, goes against the standard method of blocking or blocked training that is common in schools and in many types of implicit skill training for example, practicing a sport. While blocked training is convenient for many learners, several previous studies have shown that interleaving can yield statistically significant advantages in learning and in improving memory over blocking. The present study explored the effects of interleaving versus blocked training for learning Spanish verb conjugation skills. Participants with many different language backgrounds excepting Spanish learned to conjugate verbs in the Spanish imperfect and preterite tenses in either a blocked format or interleaved format in a between-subjects design. After a one-week delay, a verb conjugation test was administered. On average, participants learned Spanish verb conjugation skills better if they had been trained using interleaving. This result suggests that interleaving can be beneficial for foreign language learning.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",3,11.99,154,0,0.468,0.22727272727272727,0.07051282051282051,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,

"For over a decade, learning scientists have compared the effects of learning one skill or topic at a time blocking or blocked training against a technique in which two or more skills are learned simultaneously by switching back and forth between them interleaving or interleaved training. Some studies have found benefits of interleaving and others have found benefits to blocking. For instance, interleaving benefits have been observed for learning algebraic rules e.g., Mayfield & Chase, 2002 and geometric concepts e.g., Taylor & Rohrer, 2010, whereas blocking benefits have been observed for learning to identify degrees of varying line segments e.g., Goldstone, 1996 and French pronunciation rules e.g., Carpenter & Mueller, 2013.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",4,11.99,111,0,0.3125,0.2962962962962963,0.09821428571428571,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,
"Most schools implement blocking for a variety of topics because classes typically do not have enough time during the day to get through entire lesson plans. The use of blocked scheduling, wherein only one skill or concept is covered at one time, alleviates these types of problems. Other reasons include the fact that it is easier for both teachers and students to use blocking because it involves simpler schedules. But is this type of training method optimal for learning, and more importantly, does it yield better retention of learned information and skills over time than interleaving?","[0, 0, 100, 20]",4,11.99,96,0,0.2475,0.17708333333333334,0.041666666666666664,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,

This was implemented to ensure that participants were retaining learned information in long-term memory over an extended period and not just immediately after exposure.

"Previous studies have shown that blocked learning can yield better results compared to interleaving, including for language learning. However, such experiments e.g., Carpenter & Mueller, 2013 have not tested the long-term effect of interleaving. As such, the finding that blocked learning sometimes yields better results may reflect recent exposure to practice. Indeed, the present study demonstrated that interleaving has benefits for language learning when such learning is measured after a delay as compared to right away.

"INTERLEAVING AND LANGUAGE LEARNING 8 results were much better compared to learning one tense in the first session and then learning a new tense in the second session.

"It seems unintuitive that the participants who did better on the final test, namely those in the interleaved learning group, thought that the material was more difficult to learn as compared to the blocked learning group. It would seem logical to think that if participants thought material was easier to learn, then they would perform better on the final test than individuals who thought the material was hard to learn. However, a major theoretical explanation for the benefits of interleaving is that it strengthens memory associations by changing the solution to the practice problem with each attempt Rohrer, 2012. That is, because of the switching between different skills or concepts that occurs during interleaving, the solution to any given practice problem is not the same as the previous problem. This makes with using interleaving seem difficult. By contrast, if the practice problems in a single session have the same pathway to get to a similar solution each and every time, as occurs during blocking, then answering such problems seems much easier. However, this method is less effective at strengthening memory associations. Thus, in this case, the easier method of training does not yield better learning.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",9,11.99,195,0,0.514,0.18461538461538463,0.046153846153846156,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,

"INTERLEAVING AND LANGUAGE LEARNING 9 blocked learning. By having to answer using different responses, the brain is engaged in the materials all the way through a learning session. In the current study, as the learning session continued, this process was likely repeated over and over again, and in doing so, it reinforced neuronal connections in the brain associated with responding in a correct manner to the proper Spanish verb conjugation rules. By contrast, under blocked training, participants are responding in the same way each and every time. Their short-term memory is sufficient to answer questions and it seems easier as compared to the interleaved learning group, but less long-term learning occurs as a result.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",10,11.99,114,0,0.305,0.18421052631578946,0.07758620689655173,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,
"Another possibility is that participants in the blocked learning group were only learning to conjugate verbs for a particular tense instead of learning both tenses and the rules for when to use one tense over another in a proper sentence as the interleaving participants learned to do.

"The logic behind these explanations reappear when participants are asked how well they thought that they learned the material. After participants in the blocked learning group finished a training session, they usually had a higher tendency to think that they had learned the material well than participants in the interleaved learning group because the material was easier to learn. This is likely because of the fact that as they were moving through a learning session, they were providing the same types of responses over and over again repeatedly and executing the same type of response yields a higher chance of being correct. But this type of responding is redundant.

If these results are true, and hold true in other areas of learning, then academic success in schools could be heightened as with post-graduate research, skills such as learning a sport or a particular type of medical procedure could be learned quicker and with higher success, and learning different languages could be faster and with longer-lasting effects.
