"Information security infosec is largely the practice of preventing unauthorized access to data. Unauthorized access is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used in an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the risks of others having access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the risk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that information technology’s IT typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with a seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most valuable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of information security professionals.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",7,10.5,154,0,0.3985,0.18471337579617833,0.0641025641025641,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,
"Malicious software, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system.

"Integrity is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with.

"Availability means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when needed. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and not allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to be accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of implementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In an extreme case, denial of service DoS attacks can actually target availability.

This chapter is meant to serve as a brief and gentle introduction to the cryptographic concepts often encountered in the field of security. It is by no means exhaustive but it should provide a basis for a better understanding of why protocols are designed the way they are. Cryptography is a method of scrambling data into non-readable text. It allows us to transform data into a secure form so that unauthorized users cannot view it.,"[0, 0, 100, 20]",13,10.5,75,0,0.18,0.19736842105263158,0.05263157894736842,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,

"By using a secure and confidential encrypted channel we can be sure that anyone who intercepts our communications cannot ""listen in."" This helps prevents man-in-the-middle MITM attacks. Cryptography can also be used to provide integrity : proving that the data is valid. With cryptography you can provide a signature for the data showing that the person who claims to have sent it really did send it. Cryptography also allows for non-repudiation as it can show that only one person was capable of sending a particular message. Lastly cryptography also allows us to perform authentication without storing passwords in plaintext.

"Typically a series of random bytes can be used as a key to either encrypt or decrypt data. A key is used by a cryptographic algorithm to change plaintext to ciphertext. Keys may also be asymmetric in that they can only be used to perform one of the operations either encryption or decryption.

Likewise the randomness of the data in the key also makes it stronger. If the byte sequence is somehow predictable, the length is irrelevant.

Dictionary based attacks against password hashes are fairly common. Typically software is used which generates a hash for every word in the dictionary and then compares that hash to what is stored on the compromised machine. One way to combat this is through salting or adding random bits to each password. When salting the bits are stored with the hash. This forces a dictionary based attack to actively generate the hashes based on what the salt is as opposed to using a stored table rainbow table of all the possible hashes. It can make attacks go from instant to days or even years depending on the complexity of the password.,"[0, 0, 100, 20]",17,10.5,110,0,0.2605,0.23636363636363636,0.05454545454545454,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,

Given the same seed a rolling code allowshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollingcode each device to generate a sequence of codes that are exactly the same.

The receiver will validate the recieved code if it matches any of the next several codes in the sequence in case the button was hit a few times out of range. This effectively mitigates the replay attack. Given that this was implemented in the 1980s with garage door remotes, you would assume car manufacturers employ the same technology in their remotes.

"It is hard to talk about cryptography without addressing blockchains, one of the concepts behind cryptocurrencies. A blockchain is a shared ledger of transactions in the case of BitCoin where blocks are constantly being added to add to the information being stored. Periodically an new block is created, which includes a hash of the previous block and a hash of itself for the next block to reference. By examining these hashes, you can prove the integrity each block and its position, thus making a publicly-available, mutually agreed upon accounting of what has occurred on the network. Typically to prevent bad actors from adding block some sort of proof of work, a mathematically difficult operation, or proof of stake, an accounting of investment in the network, must be included when adding a block to the chain.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",24,10.5,135,0,0.342,0.17777777777777778,0.04411764705882353,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,

"Let’s assume we wanted to hash the message ""Hello from Karl"" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely represent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase, and then arrange all the letters alphabetically. ""Hello from Karl"" becomes ""aefhklllmoorr"". You can think of it like saying, ""There is one 'a' in the message, one 'e' in the message, one 'f' in the message', one 'k' in the message, three 'l’s in the message…"" Now our hash, ""aefhklllmoorr"", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.

MD5 is a message-digest algorithm that produces significantly better hashes than our Anagram algorithm. Most Linux distributions include a simple utility for creating an MD5 hash based on a file’s contents. This command is named md5sum. Typically this is used to detect if a file has been tampered with. A website may provide links to download software as well as an MD5 hash of the files so that you know what you’ve downloaded is correct.

Currently there are two main versions of the IP protocol, IPv4 and IPv6, and one of the major differences is in how many IP addresses are available. IPv4 supports 32 bit addresses and IPv6 supports 128 bit addresses. To give an idea of how big of a change that is, we have currently allocated all possible IPv4 addresses, but with IPv6 we could give an address to every grain of sand on the beaches of earth and still not run out.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",41,10.5,176,0,0.415,0.1534090909090909,0.14689265536723164,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,

"From a security standpoint, the way addresses are used in IPv4 vs IPv6 has big consequences.

Discretional Access Control DAC simplifies things by allowing owners of objects to determine which permissions groups/users should be given to that object. This offers great flexibility and ease of implementation, but can result in a less secure environment if the owner of the object is compromised. Role-Based Access Control RBAC builds off of DAC uses a core set of roles within a system to determine who has different levels of access to objects. RBAC is a common and flexible model which can be intelligently used to implement DAC or MAC. Attribute-Based access control ABAC is a newer model that builds off of RBAC and uses more general attributes instead of just roles. ABAC can determine who has different levels of access to objects based on the attributes of the object, the user, the action, or even an external context.

"OpenID is another protocol that allows users to authenticated using a third-party identity provider in a similar fashion to SAML. One of the main differences is that OpenID was designed to be decentralized, allowing for multiple IDPs for users to choose from. In February 2014 OpenID introduced OpenID Connect OIDC, a more modern system that allows IDPs to provide information about users via a REST API. This move was largely in response to the popularity of OAuth. OAuth is a method for allowing websites to access parts of a user’s profile with the user’s permission. OAuth is not technically a full-fledged authentication protocol, but it is often used as part of one.
