"About editing text and images Adobe Acrobat provides powerful tools and capabilities for editing PDF images and text. You might encounter formatting challenges that require manual adjustments. Acrobat's image-editing capabilities are limited, and using high-resolution images can lead to performance issues due to larger file sizes. To address this, improve images using other tools before adding them to PDF documents. If the original font isn't available, font substitutions may occur, altering the text's appearance. To maintain consistency across devices, we suggest you use the available fonts or embed them within the PDF. You can also enhance document accessibility using Acrobat's features, such as adding alternative text for images and proper content tagging. Refer to the following topics to learn how to add, resize, move, or replace images and objects in a PDF using Acrobat. Add images in a PDF 1. Open the PDF in Acrobat. Select Edit a PDF from the All tools menu and then select Image . 2. From the drop-down menu, select Choose image to select an image from your device or Select Generate image to generate an image from text.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",13,12.45,184,0,0.48,0.1871657754010695,0.1578947368421052,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,4.02,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,,0,1.0,Text/Paragraph
