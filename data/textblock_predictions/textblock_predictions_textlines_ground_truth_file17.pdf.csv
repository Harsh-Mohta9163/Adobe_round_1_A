Generally, FSCW can be designed with two different arrangements: single layer SL or double layer DL. In principle, each slot is occupied with one coil side for SL, while two coil sides can be included in each slot for DL 2, 3. SL produces higher harmonic content in back-electromotive force back-EMF and magnetomotive force MMF than DL, and thereby has a potentially higher overload torque capability than DL 3. In addition, the greater electric, magnetic, and thermal isolation between SL phases is usually considered to make SL a more suitable candidate for FT PMSMs than DL 2–6.

"For safety-critical applications, the fault tolerance should be ensured in multiphase PMSMs. Among various fault kinds, open-phase faults OPFs and short-circuit faults SCFs are commonly investigated in FT PMSMs 1. Some fault types in multiphase drives, e.g., open-/short-circuit switch faults and high-resistance connections, can be adapted as OPFs 1. Some freedom degrees are missed under OPFs depending on the fault locations, and thereby torque ripple usually increases if the machine control is not adapted. With FT control, an enhanced performance can be achieved, in terms of maximizing torque production with ripple-free torque and minimizing stator copper losses, by optimizing the phase currents 7. However, some phases having higher rms current values than others tend to overheat, and hence, the torque capability is constrained with the thermal limits 8. Operating PMSMs beyond their thermal limits can lead to insulation degradation and an increased risk of PM demagnetization 1. Thermal analysis under OPFs is therefore crucial for identifying localized hot-spot regions, enabling the development of effective FT control strategies that ensure better temperature distribution and reasonable machine derating 4, 8–10.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",1,9.96,178,0,0.5265,0.1910112359550561,0.1063829787234042,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,,0,1.0,Text/Paragraph
"The thermal behavior of FT PMSMs under SCFs should also receive a great attention, because of the large resulting currents and losses. Most severely, one or more turns of a specific phase may be short-circuited, which is termed as an inter-turn fault ITF. The fault current in an ITF is inversely proportional to the number of shorted turns 11 and depends on its location, with closer to the slot opening being more critical 1, 12. For each phase driven by a separate fullbridge FB inverter commonly adopted in PMSMs 5, 6, 11, applying a terminal short circuit SC through the two upper/lower switches is the simplest remedial action to tolerate ITFs 12. The circulating SC current produces a flux linkage opposing the PM flux linkage in the shorted turns 11. Alternatively, the mutual interaction between the faulty and healthy phases can be exploited to alleviate the SC current in the shorted turns. To do so, the healthy-phase currents should be adapted such that the mutual flux linkage of the healthy phases nulls the PM flux linkage in the shorted turns 7. This method is more feasible for DL than for SL since the mutual coupling between phases is higher 3. Accordingly, the remarks in 2–7 about the SL isolation being preferred for FT PMSMs are questionable.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",2,9.96,216,0,0.5255,0.1435185185185185,0.1221719457013574,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,,0,1.0,Text/Paragraph
"To assess the thermal performance of a machine design, there are two main approaches, as follows.

"Many research works have used numerical analysis to assess the thermal performance of FT PMSMs either with SL 4 or DL 8 under healthy and faulty conditions. Bianchi et al. 5 perform 2D thermal FEA of a five-phase PMSM with SL under OPFs while keeping the rated copper losses. To achieve higher postfault torque, not only the healthy-phase currents surpass the rated value, but also the hot-spot temperature is higher than that of rated healthy condition. On the contrary, Jiang et al. 8 evaluate the thermal performance of a fivephase PMSM with DL under minimum-loss ML currentcontrol strategy while respecting the maximum temperature rise of rated healthy operation. In this manner, the healthyphase currents, under various OPF cases, can exceed the rated machine current to increase the torque, while maintaining the hot-spot temperature of rated normal operation. Furthermore, an FT control method with an even temperature distribution between faulty and healthy modules of a modular PMSM is proposed in 10. To achieve this, an electromagnetic-thermal coupled model is used in the iterative algorithm to generate the optimum module current. In the same context, the ML and maximum-torque MT current-control strategies are compared at rated healthy conditions from the thermal point of view in 4, 9. It has been found that MT exhibits higher maximum temperature rise than ML, because higher copper losses are obtained under MT to achieve the rated healthy torque. All Fig. 1.

"For high-speed applications, a relatively low pole number is typically selected among the possible FSCW slotpole combinations 14. Since close values of slot and pole numbers achieve a high fundamental winding factor and a high torque density 14, the 12-slot/10-pole and 12-slot/14pole combinations are usually considered in the FSCW PMSM design. Nevertheless, the 12-slot/14-pole PMSM offers better field-weakening capability, higher power density, and greater values of maximum speed, compared with the 12-slot/10pole counterpart 15. Moreover, it also results in reduced torque ripple and lower material cost 14. Accordingly, the 12-slot/14-pole FSCW 6PMSM is considered as a case study.

"The generated losses of both machines at the same rated torque and speed from the electromagnetic model are injected as heat sources in the thermal model to obtain the steadystate temperature distribution. Fig. 5 shows the temperature distribution of both designs. The maximum temperatures are located at the end windings. Both layouts exhibit uniform temperature distributions across phases due to the equal phasecurrent rms values under healthy conditions displayed in Fig. 3. However, due to the thermal coupling between DL phases, the DL hot-spot temperature reduces by 9 . 02% with respect to SL, as shown in Fig. 5. To clarify whether the decrease in hot-spot temperature for DL is due to its lower losses or to its different thermal conductance across its heat transfer paths, another simulation is performed. Namely, the input losses of SL are manually forced to be the same as for DL in Ansys Fluent, as indicated in Table V.

"Opening phase a makes it a passive phase, while the other healthy phases are active ones. The heat transfer between active and passive phases can be better exploited for DL than for SL due to the physical sharing of two DL phases within the same slot. As depicted in Fig. 7, DL outperforms SL by lowering the maximum temperature by 11 . 04%. Moreover, if the losses of DL are manually forced as equal inputs for both SL and DL, as shown in Table V and Fig. 8, the maximum temperature for DL is still lower by 9 . 30%. This confirms the relation of the DL temperature decrease with the higher thermal conductances of DL between phases, regardless of the losses.

Consequently, reducing this temperature is essential to avoid problems like PM demagnetization, insulation degradation, and thermal runaway 1. In contrast to the maximum temperature of OPF case, the faulty phase in ITF case produces the highest temperature with respect to other healthy phases due to the excessive SC current in the faulty phase. It can be observed from Fig. 9 that the hot-spot temperature is higher for DL than for SL, mainly due to the higher copper losses of DL compared with SL in this case see Table III. Nevertheless, if the losses of SL are manually defined to match the DL losses, DL showcases a 10 . 19% lower hot-spot temperature than SL, as depicted in Fig. 10 and Table V.

"In this study, the steady-state temperature distribution of FSCW 6PMSMs with both SL and DL windings is investigated using CFD-based thermal model under the prospective operating cases healthy, OPF, and ITF. Under each case, both layouts are thermally compared twice: one at the same rated torque and speed, and the other at the same input losses. Thanks to the reduction of the MMF harmonics for DL, it achieves reduced total losses by 9 . 50% and 9 . 24% under healthy and OPF conditions, respectively, compared with SL. However, under the ITF case, it generates 19 . 85% higher losses than SL, possibly due to the mutual flux linkage of healthy phases boosting the PM flux in shorted turns.
