"1  N 2 O 5 reactivity has been measured directly for the first time on ambient aerosol particles using an entrained aerosol flow reactor coupled to a custom-built chemical ionization mass spectrometer at two urban locations during summer. The observed N 2 O 5 reactivity is a strong function of both relative humidity RH and particle chemical composition. We show that particulate organic mass loadings, together with ambient relative humidity, play a leading role in determining the reaction rate of N 2 O 5 with particles. Our observed reactivity values are both more variable and, at times, as much as a factor of ten lower than currently implemented large-scale model parameterizations would predict. Such discrepancies have likely consequences for predictions of NO x availability and ozone production, and the sensitivity of these quantities to aerosol particle loadings. Citation: Bertram, T.

"2  The production of tropospheric ozone O 3 , a criteria air pollutant and potent greenhouse gas, is a complex function of nitrogen oxides NO x = NO + NO 2 , volatile organic compounds VOC, sunlight, and trace oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical OH. O 3 production is nonlinearly dependent on NO x abundance and thus accurate description of the processes that remove NO x radicals is critical for predicting the down-wind influence of anthropogenic emissions on tropospheric O 3 . Global modeling studies suggest that nocturnal processes involving the reactions of the nitrate radical NO 3  and N 2 O 5 account for 50% of the globally averaged annual net NO x removal Dentener and Crutzen, 1993. However, the impact of nocturnal NO x removal processes on the tropospheric O 3 budget continues to be limited by uncertainty in the reaction rate of N 2 O 5 with aerosol particles.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",1,10.0,153,0,0.3625,0.081081081081081,0.1543624161073825,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,,0,1.0,Text/Paragraph

The dependence of F lost on gN 2 O 5  and NO 3 reactivity, as calculated using a time-dependent chemical box model see SI for characteristic summer and winter conditions, is shown in Figure 3. We chose conditions e.g., temperature and NO 3 reactivity in order to bracket the range of possible sensitivities to gN 2 O 5 . In our summer calculations, F lost is primarily limited by the NO 3 production rate and nearly independent of gN 2 O 5  due to assuming high loadings of biogenic volatile organic compounds BVOC, which increase NO 3 reactivity, and warmer temperatures, which shift the N 2 O 5 -NO 3 equilibrium in favor of NO 3 . The result is that at high NO 3 reactivity the nocturnal loss of NO x is independent of gN 2 O 5 . During winter, BVOC emissions are significantly smaller, and lower temperatures shift the N 2 O 5 -NO 3 equilibrium in favor of N 2 O 5 . As a result, F lost is far more sensitive to gN 2 O 5  during winter than in summer. These calculations illustrate the acute sensitivity of the NO x budget to changes in gN 2 O 5  between 1 � 10 �4 and 0.1 and imply that the NO x lifetime is strongly dependent on NO 3 reactivity at low gN 2 O 5 .","[0, 0, 100, 20]",4,10.0,345,0,0.674,0.1174698795180722,0.1764705882352941,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,,0,1.0,Text/Paragraph
"15  In addition to accurate predictions of the total nocturnal NO x loss, models must also correctly attribute that loss between the N 2 O 5 and NO 3 channels to achieve a realistic sensitivity of the NO x budget to changes in VOC, temperature, and particle loadings. Our modeling shows this branching is sensitive to gN 2 O 5  for the majority of likely conditions. The reaction products for the two channels have different effects on oxidant concentrations and particle mass loadings: the products of NO 3 homogeneous reactions can 17  We present an analysis of the first direct measurements of gN 2 O 5  on ambient aerosol particles. At the limit of low POM, our observations confirm RH as a primary control and particulate nitrate as a secondary control in strong dependence ofregulating gN 2 O 5 . Observations at high RH illustrate a gN 2 O 5  on particle POM/SO 24� . Our recent parameterization Bertram and Thornton, 2009 can adequately capture the trend and variability in the observed gN 2 O 5  if we make the assumption that the increasing POM mass fractions do not contribute significantly to additional particulate water uptake at the same RH. In such a case, the nitrate effect is sufficient to explain our results. If POM does contribute to H 2 Ol uptake, then our results suggest an additional means of suppressing gN 2 O 5  that is correlated with oxidized POM such as organic coatings. Regardless, these results clearly indicate that regional and global modeling efforts need to consider the effects of particulate organic loadings and hygroscopicity in parameterizing the rate of nocturnal NO x loss via N 2 O 5 reactions on particles.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",4,10.0,284,0,0.682,0.0992907801418439,0.1378091872791519,0,0,-20.0,0.0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,,0,1.0,Text/Paragraph
