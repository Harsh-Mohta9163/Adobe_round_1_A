"Lisa A. Keister says that religion influences the accumulation of wealth directly because “it shapes values and priorities, contributes to the set of competencies from which action is constructed, and may provide important social contacts.” Lisa A. Keister states that “people draw on the tools they learn from religion to develop consistent strategies for dealing with problems and for making decisions such as savings, investment, and consumption decisions.” She concludes that that there is solid evidence to confirm that being raised Jewish and practicing Judaism leads to the accumulation of wealth.
