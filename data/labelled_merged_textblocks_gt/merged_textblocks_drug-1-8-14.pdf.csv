"Figure 3 presents the saliency maps generated by interpreting XGDP based on GAT and GATE. We observe that when edge features are absent in GAT convolutions, the model is likely to assign inconsistent saliency scores to atoms and bonds that are connected. Specifically, the case of atom with a high positive score and bond with a low negative score attached to the atom happens regularly in GAT-based models. This phenomenon thus hinders the study of substructure importance, since attached atom and bond are assigned with highly contrary saliency scores. However, this problem is overcomed by GATE-based XGDP which incorporates edge features in model training. In the right column of Fig. 3, the significant red and insignificant blue structures are separated clearly instead of mixed with each other.

"This study introduced a novel framework XGDP to predict response levels of anti-cancer drugs and discover underlying mechanism of action of drugs. To enhance the predictive power of GNN models, first we adapted the Morgan algorithm that is used for computing ECFPs to form our node features. Same procedures as Morgan algorithm were followed to identify the substructures of the molecule but the feature vector of each atom was assigned as the membership of the identified structures. Then we incorporated the type of chemical bonds as the edge features. These strategies enabled us to depict the molecule in a more meticulous manner and was testified to improve the GNN?s prediction in terms of RMSE and PCC. Furthermore, we also attempted to explore relational GNN in the drug response prediction task, which describes edges as different relations and develops distinct message passing patterns for them. It was shown that RGCN outperformed GCN without edge features. However, due to the limited GPU resources, we were not able to train the RGAT model with an optimal batch size.

"Moreover, we leveraged state-of-the-art attribution approaches in deep learning, GNNExplainer and Integrated Gradients, to explain our developed model. The explanations were visualized as saliency maps of both molecules and genes. Remarkably, those saliency maps could be supported by the SAR studies of the drugs. Consequently, we claim that our model is able to capture the significant functional groups of drugs and their potential targeted genes, and thus reveal the comprehensive mechanism of action of drugs. In the future, we intend to extend this study to a multi-omics level. Although genes contain the most vital information of the cause of disease, they do not directly interact with drugs in most cases. Therefore, protein and metabolites data should be considered. In addition, gene mutation and DNA methylation data may have a more direct reflection on the somatic abnormality, which are also expected to be explored in future works.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",5,9,146,0,0.401,0.1506849315068493,0.08666666666666667,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
