"Simple Summary: Recently, there has been a serious decline in honey bee colonies due to various factors, including habitat loss, diseases, pathogen infections, chemical exposures, and climatic changes. Among these factors, malnutrition-induced stress plays a significant role in colony decline. In our study, we present a novel perspective on maintaining and developing honey bee colonies. Our research demonstrates that a specific pollen substitute diet significantly improves colony performance during early spring, as evidenced by an increase in population, a greater capped brood area, altered colony weight, honey bee weight dried head + thorax, and vitellogenin value. This finding could contribute to enhanced colony maintenance and development during the early spring season, with the potential to prevent colony decline.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",1,8.99,118,0,0.356,0.145299145,0.059322034,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.09,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"Abstract: The nutritional quality of a colony significantly affects its health and strength, particularly because it is required for population growth in the early spring. We investigated the impact of various artificial pollen substitute diets on colony performance in the Republic of Korea during early spring, a critical period for colony health and growth. The colonies were provided with different diets, including the commercial product Megabee positive control, our developed diet Test A, and four upgraded versions Diet 1, Diet 2, Diet 3, and Diet 4 of Test A. The negative control group received no supplementary feed. Over 63 days, we observed 24 experimental colonies and assessed various parameters at the colony and individual levels. The results revealed that Diet 2 had the highest consumption and had the most positive impact on population growth, the capped brood area, colony weight, honey bees’ weight, and vitellogenin levels. These findings suggested that Diet 2 is most attractive to honey bees and thus holds great promise for improving colony maintenance and development during the crucial early spring period.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",1,8.99,175,0,0.48,0.107954545,0.12,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.03,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"Honey bees  Apis mellifera L. primarily rely on nectar and pollen as their sources of nutrition. They use nectar to produce honey, which serves as their primary carbohydrate source  1 . Carbohydrates are the primary component of a honey bee’s diet and supply energy for various functions, including muscular activity, maintaining body heat, and supporting the essential operations of specific organs and glands, such as wax production  2 . Pollen provides a colony with nutritious proteins, lipids, vitamins, and minerals, all of which are required for the growth of broods  3 .

"and drone reproductive quality, brood rearing, adult population development, and royal jelly production 4. Emerging bees and nurse bees require pollen or protein supplements in their diet that offer an adequate quantity and diversity of amino acids, as certain pollen may lack essential amino acids that bees cannot synthesize themselves and require for their nutritional needs  2 . In 1953, De Groot reported that honey bees require arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine as essential amino acids  5 . However, the expansion of intensively cultivated landscapes is associated with a decrease in the protein content of beebread, which is fermented from pollen and serves as a primary protein source for honey bees 6.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",2,9.95,118,0,0.3345,0.128205128,0.043103448,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.01,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Beekeepers feed supplementary pollen or pollen substitutes during times of pollen dearth to maintain colony strength  7 . The protein-rich substances used in artificial bee diets include soy, pea, yeast, casein, eggs, and microalgae  2, 3 . Ideal pollen substitutes should be fully accepted by honey bees year-round, provide comprehensive nutritional support to meet their dietary needs, and be cost-effective  8 . A pollen substitute diet should contain protein, lipids, and other nutritional sources  1, 2, 8 . A consistent supply of pollen or a protein-supplemented diet can encourage brood raising and promote colony expansion  7 . However, adult workers who are nutritionally stressed, such as larvae, might experience weight loss, shorter survival, less foraging activity, and more aggressive dance behavior  9 . Many beekeepers commonly use commercial or artificial diets to compensate for apparent nutritional deficiencies 2,8.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",2,9.99,138,0,0.396,0.121212121,0.051094891,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Several studies have explored the effects of different feeding diets on honey bees. Vg is a yolk protein that is extensively produced in the fat body, released into the hemolymph, and subsequently incorporated by oocytes during development  10 . It is also absorbed in nurse bees’ hypopharyngeal glands, serving as an amino acid source for the production of royal jelly  11 . These studies assessed changes in vitellogenin Vg levels in the hemolymph to various types of pollen diets. Differences in these responses depended on the diet during early spring. However, it is important to note that these studies did not evaluate colonylevel performance  12 . In another study, honey bee diets, including both pollen-mixed diets and diets with no pollen, were evaluated. Diet consumption, the number of frames, the honey bee head + thorax weight, Vg levels, and the gut microbiota were measured  3 . However, there was no significant effect on Vg expression in the diets examined. The quantity of deformed wing virus DWV is used to determine colony strength and is considered an adverse indicator of honey bees’ fitness  13 . One of the most common and pervasive viral infections of A. mellifera in the world is DWV  14 . In newly emerged honey bees, DWV infection leads to morphological abnormalities such as deformed wings and early death  15 . A significant correlation exists between the DWV titer and colony loss during overwintering  16 . These studies also analyzed the nutritional content of the diets they consumed. In our previous study, we conducted similar nutritional content analyses on artificially developed diets with commercial products and beebread  17 . Our development diets had comparable nutritional content to the commercial diet but a higher total free amino acid content. Subsequently, in the present study, we assessed the colony performance of our developed diets at both the colony and individual levels.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",2,9.97,311,0,0.805,0.141914191,0.082781457,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.01,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"To address deficiencies in available nutritive pollen forage in the environment, apiculturists often supplement honey bee colonies with artificial and commercial diets. This supplemental feeding is known to stimulate brood production, facilitating the expansion of colony populations  24, 25, 27 . The nutritive value of the diet significantly influences the development, reproduction, and overall productivity of honey bees  28 .

"Sugars, amino acids, and lipids are recognized as nutritionally valuable elements that enhance the appeal of a diet to diverse mutualistic animals, with the recent identification of additional appealing constituents, such as volatile organic compounds  30 . Consumption is a key indicator for understanding the quality and impact of a diet. It can be influenced by multiple cues from the colony and from the diet. In this study, the colony size could not be normalized prior to the experiment. There was a significant difference in the number of honey bees on 21 February among the diets. Test A and Control had the highest number of honey bees. However, the Diet 2 treatment had the greatest increase in the number of honey bees during the experimental period, which indicated that the Diet 2 treatment positively influenced colony development. According to the consumption analysis, the highest consumption was observed in the Diet 2 treatment group, marking the initial attempt to integrate apple juice into the honey bee diet. Given this observation, it is pertinent to delve into the specific components within apple juice that attract honey bees. A comprehensive analysis of the sugar content across 103 apple cultivars revealed that fructose exhibited the highest concentration  31 . These findings led to the hypothesis that the appeal of Diet 2 to honey bees may be attributed to its elevated fructose content. In our previous nutritional analysis, Diet 2 presented a slightly greater fructose content than the other diets  17 . In the literature, honey bees have shown a preference for foraging on apple pollen  32 . Insects recognize food through a combination of behavioral responses, sensory mechanisms, and the perception of host-released odors  33 . The sensory system relies on visual, olfactory, and gustatory cues  33 . Moreover, the behavioral aspect involves experience-based learning and orientation mechanisms, all of which contribute to the identification of food sources  33 . Honey bees have 10 gustatory receptor genes in their genome. Among them, AmGr1 exhibits broad responses to sugars such as sucrose, glucose, trehalose, and maltose  34 . AmGr2 serves as a coreceptor for AmGr1. Moreover, AmGr3 responds specifically to a particular fructose  34 . These findings suggested that fructose has significant nutritional value for honey bees, but further detailed research is needed. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanism responsible for the speciesspecific feeding preferences of insects is limited. Further in-depth investigations may be warranted to validate and explore this observation.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",10,9.99,407,0,1.1085,0.128140704,0.08478803,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.06,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"In another study, a strong correlation was observed between diet consumption and changes in brood area and adult population size  24 . In the present study, Diet 2, which had the highest consumption of colonies, also had the largest brood area and adult population. These findings suggested that this particular diet fosters the overall development of the colony, particularly in the early spring season. Furthermore, diet consumption plays a crucial role in the conversion of honey bees to Vg, the most abundant nutrient storage molecule in honey bees, which is subsequently transformed into brood feed in the form of royal jelly  12 . Notably, the Diet 2-fed honey bees exhibited the highest Vg gene expression levels. Therefore, among the colonies produced from the tested diets, those produced from the Diet 2 treatment had the highest brood area and adult population. Preference analysis further supported these findings, with Diet 1 emerging as the most preferred diet among the options three times more favored than Test A, followed by Diet 2 and Diet 3. The nutritional value and taste of Diet 1, Diet 2, and Diet 3 likely contributed to their higher preference scores. It has been established that honey bees exhibit a preference for pollen sources rich in both protein and lipids  29, 35 . Honey bees might also consider nutritional value when making diet choices. In our previous study, the preferred diets, Diet 1, Diet 2, and Diet 3, had slightly greater total amino acid contents than the other tested diets. Additionally, Diet 1 exhibited the highest total inorganic ion content among the tested diets  17 . Further confirmation is necessary to validate the actual role of specific nutritional components in honey bee health and to understand their physiological contributions to honey bee health. Colony population dynamics revealed significant differences among the diets, emphasizing the role of nutrition in colony growth.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",10,10.02,311,0,0.8135,0.104234528,0.100649351,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.17,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Among the diet groups, the Diet 2 group exhibited the most pronounced increase in population density. These findings indicate that these diets positively influence brood development and subsequent population expansion as the new generation of honey bees grows well. In contrast, Control-, Diet 3-, Diet 4-, and Megabee-fed honey bee colonies showed a decrease in population size, suggesting suboptimal dietary conditions for colony growth. In other studies, various pollen substitute diets were associated with distinct patterns of adult population growth  24, 28 . The expansion of the capped brood area across all treatment groups is an encouraging sign of successful brood development. The Diet 2-fed colony had the highest total capped brood area, reflecting its positive impact on brood rearing. The study demonstrated that differences in the nutritional composition of diets, coupled with the digestibility and nutrient accessibility to worker bees, significantly influence potential brood production  24 . This implies that in the limited floral resources period, pollen substitute diets offer ample nutrients to sustain brood rearing in colonies. Other studies, conducted with colonies placed under conditions of pollen scarcity, revealed that those colonies receiving supplements demonstrated an improved capacity for brood rearing compared to the control colonies  7, 8, 36, 37 . The brood-rearing capacity of a colony is directly related to the availability of nutrients.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",11,9.98,217,0,0.6315,0.130841121,0.073732719,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"During the experimental period, the colony weight decreased across all the groups. Notably, Diet 2 had the most significant reduction in colony weight. This weight loss might indicate increased consumption due to the expanding population. Notably, the absence of flowering near our experimental apiary, as flowering had not yet begun, resulted in limited access to pollen sources for honey bees. Consequently, honey bees primarily rely on the provided food sources within the colony for consumption. Another study revealed a reduction in colony weight from February to the end of March 38.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",11,10,91,0,0.2495,0.131868132,0.098901099,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Examining honey bee weight revealed variations in the dried head + thorax weights across the diets. Notably, Test A and Diet 2 exhibited the most substantial head + thorax weight gain, suggesting their favorable impact on the body development of individual honey bees. This observation aligns with the notion that a worker’s weight accurately mirrors nutritional allocation during its larval stage  39 . Greater head and thorax weights reflect enhanced development of head glands and increased flight muscle mass, which are essential attributes for the fitness of a colony  3 . Additionally, several studies have pinpointed a positive correlation between dry weight and lifespan 5,39.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",11,10.02,105,0,0.289,0.116504854,0.077669903,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.03,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Vg affects the worker sucrose response, foraging start, foraging choice, the caste differentiation process, protection from oxidative and immune attacks, and longevity 22,40–42 . The concentration of Vg, a well-known zinc Zn carrier, strongly correlates with the hemolymph Zn titer, and its hypothesized role in protecting winter bees from oxidative damage, due to Zn’s known defense against oxidative stress, suggests potential lifespanextending properties  18 . Adequate nutrient availability is essential for producing Vg, and the levels present in circulation are strongly linked to the intake of protein  43, 44 . Therefore, Vg is considered an indicator of honey bee health. In the present study, Vg gene expression levels were significantly different according to diet, with Megabee and Diet 2 inducing the highest expression levels. These findings indicate the potential of these diets to stimulate honey bee health. A positive correlation was recorded between the fat body expression levels of Vg and insulin-like peptide 1, a nutrient sensor gene in worker honey bees  44 . In other studies, the levels of Vg gene expression varied based on dietary nutrition, with honey bees fed pollen-rich diets showing higher Vg gene expression than those fed pollen-free diets 36,45.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",11,10.01,195,0,0.542,0.139896373,0.100502513,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"We investigated the impact of diet on DWV titers. The expression patterns of DWV varied among the diets; notably, Diet 3 was detected only on March 7, but its presence decreased by March 22. These findings suggested that Diet 3 might contribute to enhanced resistance against DWV. Among our diets, except for Diet 3, Diet 1, and Diet 4, it can be presumed that the feeds in which DWV was not detected among those used in the experiment may be resistant to DWV.

"Our study highlights the intricate relationships between various pollen substitute diets and honey bee performance indicators. Diet 2 demonstrated the highest consumption by honey bees, which led to an increased number of honey bees, capped brood area, colony weight, head + thorax honey bee weight, and Vg gene expression; notably, DWV infection was not detected in colonies fed Diet 2. The observed trends emphasize the pivotal role of the pollen substitute diet in sustaining honey bee health and colony development. Further research is warranted to unravel the underlying mechanisms driving these effects and their long-term implications for honey bee colonies in various environmental contexts.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",12,9.92,104,0,0.298,0.13592233,0.067307692,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
