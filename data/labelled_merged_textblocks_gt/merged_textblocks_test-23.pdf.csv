"This world improves with competition. Competing allows individuals and organizations to be better, more efficient, and smarter. When one company competes with another for market share and profit, they both learn from each other and improve together. This is the basis of the choice to analyze the financial statements of The Coca-Cola company, commonly known as “Coca Cola”, and PepsiCo, known as “Pepsi”. Both companies have some similarities, starting from the time they were created and going on to their unique way of selling their drinks. Both companies have grown together, but they have also used different strategies to expand. By comparing their balance sheets and income statements, it is expected to find be many differences, on which will be commented and studied. These differences will show how their growth model is working, their stability, their future expectations, and their inefficiencies —as it is expected to find inefficiencies in both companies.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",3,12,151,0,0.4095,0.225806452,0.098684211,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"At first Pepsi was sold in drugstores as a drink for aiding digestion but, as the years went by, it began being sold as a drink for people to enjoy Bellis 2018 Bhasin 2013. Pepsi went bankrupt in 1923 for “gambling on sugar prices” they believed that prices were going to rise, so they purchased an excessive amount of sugar. In 1931 Pepsi was sold to Loft Candy Co, but it was still not selling enough, and it was even offered to Coca-Cola during the Great Depression. Loft Candy’s president, Guth, reformulated the soda and the sales strategy and suddenly Pepsi was being sold again. In the 1960’s Pepsi reformulated their strategy and acquired Mountain Dew. Later that decade, Pepsi merged with Frito Lay to become what is now known today as PepsiCo.

"On the other hand, Coca-Cola was first sold in a soda fountain a very popular place for social gatherings at that time, usually close to an apothecary — as a drink to cure ailments. In 1888 its creator, Pemberton, died, but not before selling the company to Asa Griggs Candler who, by 1892, acquired the company and incorporated it as The Coca-Cola Company. In 1919, Coca-Cola was sold to a group of investors that began selling the beverages for home consumption. The post-World War II years saw diversification in the packaging of Coca-Cola and the development and acquisition of new products. The trademark “Coke,” first used in advertising in 1941, was registered in 1945. In 1946 the company purchased rights to Fanta, a soft drink previously developed in Germany, and to the lemon-lime drink, Sprite, in 1961. Since then, Coca-Cola has acquired various different beverages from the same sector — non-alcoholic beverages. In 1981, Roberto C. Goizueta became chairman of the board of directors and CEO of Coca-Cola. Goizueta organized the various U.S. Coca-Cola bottling operations into a new public company, Coca Cola Enterprises Inc. Coca-Cola has become one of the most recognizable brands and trademarks in the world.

"The non-alcoholic beverages sector includes mainly soft drinks and hot drinks, such as water, carbonated drinks, juices, tea, coffee, etc. Companies in the soft drink industry reach the end market in two ways. One way is by selling finished products, made at company-owned bottling facilities, to distributors and retailers. Another way is by selling beverage concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling partners, who then make the final product by combining the concentrates with still or carbonated water, sweeteners, and other ingredients. Coca-Cola and Pepsi use both ways to reach the final costumer. These two companies particularly have an incredible pricing power and can also produce and distribute third-party brands.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",4,12,109,0,0.311,0.165137615,0.07079646,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"The global soft drink market is led by carbonated soft drinks or CSDs, which had a market size of $337.8 billion in 2013. In the same year, CSDs were followed by bottled water, with a market size of $189.1 billion, and juice, with a market size of $146.2 billion. In this market there are different companies competing, the main competitors are: The Coca-Cola company, PepsiCo, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Monster Beverage Corporation, and Cott Corporation. Coca-Cola and Pepsi are part of the consumer staple sector, which is essentially composed of products that people are unlikely to stop buying regardless of their financial situation, such as beverages, tobacco, producers of non-durable goods, and personal products.

"The term soft drink originated to distinguish the flavored drinks from hard liquor or distilled spirits. Soft drinks were recommended as a substitute in the effort to change the hard-drinking habits of early Americans. In fact, health concerns of modern consumers led to new categories of soft drinks emphasizing low calorie count, low sodium content, no caffeine, and “all natural” ingredients. The regular consumption of soft drinks has been associated with multiple chronic health conditions. These increased risks are largely due to the added ingredients in soft drinks, especially sugar. Indeed, some sugar-sweetened soft drinks contain 40 grams of sugar or more per 12-ounce serving, which exceeds the recommended daily sugar intake for adults. Long-term consumption of soft drinks is linked to weight gain, obesity, and tooth decay. Sugar-free soft drinks also have been associated with dental erosion. Concerns about the negative health effects of soft drinks have given rise to debate about legally restricting their consumption through soda bans, increased soda taxes, and other regulatory measures. In January 2014 Mexico became one of the first countries to impose a nationwide revenue-raising tax on soft drinks containing added sugar. Later that year Berkeley, California, became the first city in the United States in which voters unanimously approved a tax on sugary drinks. In 2015, a ban on the sale of caffeinated soft drinks to children went into effect in the Vologda region of Russia. That same year authorities in San Francisco approved a measure that would require soft drink manufacturers to add health warnings to soft drink labels, similar to the health warnings displayed on labels for alcohol and tobacco products.

"The tax cuts and jobs act, or TCJ, is a regulatory reform that was imposed by the new Republican government at the end of 2017 and affected most international American companies. The TCJ act made several significant changes not only to companies, but also to households. As it also affected the results of Coca-Cola and Pepsi for 2017, it is this these aspects that are going to be analyzed. Essentially, the U.S government made profit repatriation more attractive for companies by establishing a tax of 15.5% for a onetime repatriation of cash, while the tax for other non-cash assets was also reduced to 8%. Before, the tax rate for profits returned to U.S was at 35%, which led many companies to keep the money that the country generated for a future reinvestment in that country or in any other one. This meant that U.S didn’t get back some of the money from profits out of the country.
