"Donors have an important role in the humanitarian data ecosystem, both as drivers of increased data collection and analysis, and as direct users of data. This is not a new phenomenon; the need for accountability and transparency in the use of donor funding is broadly understood and respected. However, in recent years, donors have begun requesting data that can be sensitive. This includes personal data about beneficiaries and various forms of disaggregated data, such as household-level survey results and data about the delivery of assistance disaggregated by demographic and/or group dimensions e.g. ethnicity, protection group, etc.. 1","[0, 0, 100, 20]",1,11.0,97,0,0.2725,0.1237113402061855,0.04,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Concerns around requests for such data have led donors and humanitarian organizations to place more emphasis on identifying strategies for data responsibility: the safe, ethical and effective management of data. Data responsibility requires donors and humanitarian organizations to take actions that help minimize risks while maximizing benefits of data. This is particularly challenging in cases where donors request sensitive data. For example, the screening of aid recipients, which is often used to justify requests for personal data, is not only difficult to practically implement, but also highly problematic in terms of principled aid. 2","[0, 0, 100, 20]",1,11.0,94,0,0.2755,0.1808510638297872,0.0425531914893617,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
