"Chemical reaction kinetics deals with the rates of chemical processes.  Any chemical process may be broken down into a sequence of one or more single-step processes known either as elementary processes, elementary reactions, or elementary steps . Elementary reactions usually involve either a single reactive collision between two molecules, which we refer to as a a bimolecular step, or dissociation/isomerisation of a single reactant molecule, which we refer to as a unimolecular step. Very rarely, under conditions of extremely high pressure, a termolecular step may occur, which involves simultaneous collision of three reactant molecules. An important point to recognise is that many reactions that are written as a single reaction equation in actual fact consist of a series of elementary steps. This will become extremely important as we learn more about the theory of chemical reaction rates.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",2,10.98,137,0,0.3815,0.102941176,0.043478261,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"As a general rule, elementary processes involve a transition between two atomic or molecular states separated by a potential barrier. The potential barrier constitutes the activation energy of the process, and determines the rate at which it occurs. When the barrier is low, the thermal energy of the reactants will generally be high enough to surmount the barrier and move over to products, and the reaction will be fast. However, when the barrier is high, only a few reactants will have sufficient energy, and the reaction will be much slower. The presence of a potential barrier to reaction is also the source of the temperature dependence of reaction rates, which we will cover in more detail in Section 19.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",2,10.98,119,0,0.2965,0.117647059,0.050420168,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"When we talk about the rate of a chemical reaction, what we mean is the rate at which reactants are used up, or equivalently the rate at which products are formed. The rate therefore has units of concentration per unit time, mol dm -3 s -1  for gas phase reactions, alternative units of concentration are often used, usually units of pressure – Torr, mbar or Pa. To measure a reaction rate, we simply need to monitor the concentration of one of the reactants or products as a function of time. There is one slight complication to our definition of the reaction rate so far, which is to do with the stochiometry of the reaction. The stoichiometry simply refers to the number of moles of each reactant and product appearing in the reaction equation. For example, the reaction equation for the well-known Haber process, used industrially to produce ammonia, is:","[0, 0, 100, 20]",2,10.98,149,0,0.3545,0.127516779,0.060402685,1,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

Similarly, monitoring the concentration of NH 3 would yield a rate of 2 x mol dm -3 s -1 . Clearly, the same reaction cannot have three different rates, so we appear to have a problem. The solution is actually very simple: the reaction rate is defined as the rate of change of the concentration of a reactant or product divided by its stochiometric coefficient . For the above reaction, the rate usually given the symbol ν is therefore Note that a negative sign appears when we define the rate using the concentration of one of the reactants.

"Multi-step processes may follow simple or complex rate laws, and as the above examples have hopefully illustrated, the rate law generally does not follow from the overall reaction equation. This makes perfect sense, since the overall reaction equation for a multi-step process is simply the net result of all of the elementary reactions in the mechanism. The ‘reaction’ given in the overall reaction equation never actually takes place! However, even though the rate law for a multi-step reaction cannot immediately be written down from the reaction equation as it can in the case of an elementary reaction, the rate law is a direct result of the sequence of elementary steps that constitute the reaction mechanism. As such, it provides our best tool for determining an unknown mechanism. As we will find out later in the course, once we know the sequence of elementary steps that constitute the reaction mechanism, we can quite quickly deduce the rate law. Conversely, if we do not know the reaction mechanism, we can carry out experiments to determine the orders with respect to each reactant see Sections 7 and 8 and then try out various ‘trial’ reaction mechanisms to see which one fits best with the experimental data. At this point it should be emphasised again that for multi-step reactions, the rate law, rate constant, and order are determined by experiment, and the orders are not generally the same as the stoichiometric coefficients in the reaction equation.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",4,10.98,242,0,0.6145,0.133603239,0.036585366,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
