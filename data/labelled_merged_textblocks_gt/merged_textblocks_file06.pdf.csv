"Cupping therapy is a simple, effective and economic treatment. Cupping therapy is a formal treatment in Chinese hospitals and in some European countries. Here, we review history of wet cupping therapy and its two distinct methodologies. First method is puncturing and cupping PC method that includes five steps: skin demarcation, sterilization, puncturing, cupping and sterilization. Second method is cupping, puncturing and cupping CPC method that includes six steps: skin demarcation, sterilization, first cupping, puncturing, second cupping and sterilization. CPC method predominates in the Arabic world, while PC method has a worldwide distribution. We report here that our detailed evidence-based analysis of both methods reveals many novel advantages in the CPC method over the PC method. CPC method has a better analgesic effect and benefits more from the viscoelastic nature of the skin. During the first cupping step in the CPC method not present in the PC method, a fluid mixture containing causative pathological substances CPS is collected inside skin uplifting due to the effect of negative pressure of sucking cups. CPS differs from disease to disease according to disease etiology and pathogenesis. That fluid mixture contains collected interstitial fluids with CPS, filtered fluids from blood capillaries with CPS, hemolyzed blood cells hemolysed RBCs, WBCs and platelets. That fluid mixture does not contain intact blood cells as their sizes are much bigger than sizes of pores of skin capillaries and cannot be filtered. The fluid mixture is totally excreted in next steps. We review here that wet cupping therapy is a highly recommended treatment in prophetic medicine, medicine related to Prophet Mohammad peace be upon him who said: “The best among what you use in therapy is Al-hijamah CPC method of wet cupping therapy”.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",1,8,283,0,0.7805,0,0.119298246,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"Cupping therapy is a simple procedure in which negative pressure is applied to the skin through sucking cups dry cupping therapy 1. Many types of cupping therapy are described in the literature including dry cupping therapy, wet cupping therapy, medicinal cupping therapy, moving cupping therapy and others 2. The most important type of wet cupping therapy seems to be Al-hijamah method of wet cupping therapy practiced in prophetic medicine. Unlike most conventional treatment modalities, wet cupping therapy is an excretory form of therapy not an introductory one i.e. wet cupping therapy uses negative pressure suctioning and skin pricking to open the skin barrier and excrete a bloody mixture of fluids with soluble wastes and causative pathological substances CPS. Second negative pressure suctioning completes the process of waste excretion. Unfortunately, medical research related to cupping therapy does not cover its importance. Cupping therapy is practiced officially in hospitals in China 3 and is considered very familiar in some European countries 4,5.

"Wet cupping therapy Al-hijamah has solid scientific and medical bases according to Taibah theory suggested by Salah M. El Sayed. Wet cupping therapy is as an artificial surgical excretory procedure that clears blood and interstitial fluids from CPS. It opens skin barrier, enhances natural excretory functions of the skin, enhances immunity and increases filtration at both capillary ends to clear blood from CPS to restore physiology and homeostasis. Moreover, it was reported that compression pressure exerted on the skin for more than few seconds as that exerted by the outline of sucking cups during Al-hijamah may benefit patients through the occurrence of reactive hyperemia phenomenon. In this phenomenon, vascular compression causes a decrease in blood supply to the skin for few minutes resulting in accumulation of vasodilator chemicals. As soon as vascular compression is removed, blood flow to skin dramatically increases, which is called hyperemia 38. This may bring more blood to the skin circulation to be filtered and cleared during next steps of Al-hijamah.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",2,9,165,0,0.455,0,0.101190476,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

Continuous accumulation of fluids increases pressure inside skin upliftings leading to immediate escape of fluids upon skin puncturing and 2 nd cupping step. Equals one cupping process PC cupping only Does not occur Does not Escape of fresh blood due to puncture trauma as occurs in wounds mixed with little tissue fluids. Pressure suctioning helps bleeding to continue and blood to come out+some tissue fluids to be excreted. Yes as tissue fluids are collected after skin puncturing and are coming out to skin surface with blood from punctured capillaries. Blood may hinder fluid accumulation inside skin upliftings leading to incomplete escape of fluids upon skin puncturing. Total time of vacuum application Long 1 st and 2 nd cupping steps Short 1 cupping step Pain sensation during puncturing Mild analgesic effect of 1 st cupping step Moderate to severe as in wounds Fluid extracted in cups Larger fluid content and less blood Higher blood content Tapping puncture site to bleed Not needed Usually done Fluid collection in skin upliftings Skin upliftings form before skin puncturing step and contain only fluids with fragmented blood cells and causative pathological substances intact blood cells do not diffuse through capillary fenestrae due to size barrier. Skin upliftings form after skin puncturing step and contain mainly fresh blood with little fluid intact blood comes from punctured capillaries Puncturing causes blood excretion and suctioning creates skin uplifting with excretion of more blood and some tissue fluids. Less. PC method partially clears interstitial spaces, capillary blood and lymphatics until closure of skin barrier by blood thrombus due to lack of prior fluid collection and incomplete transmission of sucking pressure due to antagonizing effect of bleeding, adhesions and intervening fluids Sequence of events 1 st cupping creates skin uplifting. puncturing skin causes simultaneous simultaneous excretion of tissue fluid mixed with some blood, 2 nd cupping causes more extrusion of both. Expected blood clearance effect More due to high fluid content filtered fluids from capillaries+excreted tissue fluids.
