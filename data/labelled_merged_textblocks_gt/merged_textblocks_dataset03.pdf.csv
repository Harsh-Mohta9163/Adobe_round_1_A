This document summarizes the documentation and findings developed in the peer review of the Anticipatory Action Trigger for Drought in Niger. The trigger mechanism was designed for an anticipatory action framework coordinated by OCHA. The goal of the trigger mechanism is to detect increased drought risk in Niger and trigger the release of funds from the Central Emergency Response Fund in anticipation of drought-related humanitarian needs. The release of funds can be triggered from six months ahead of the rainy season which runs from July through September until one month into the season. The trigger mechanism includes a predictive model that uses seasonal precipitation forecasts and an observational model that uses the Standardized Precipitation Index.,"[0, 0, 100, 20]",2,11,115,0,0.324,0.12173913043478261,0.1810344827586207,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
