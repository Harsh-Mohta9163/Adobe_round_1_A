"Like other invertebrates, honey bees too are poikilothermic animals; they cannot regulate their body temperature and they have to undergo a period of inactivation when atmospheric temperature is untolerable. During this period, their nutritional requirements and metabolic activities are minimized due to highly restricted foraging activities. The egg-laying by queen and rearing of unsealed and sealed brood are decreased, however their extent is governed by the quantum of stored food available. The problems of deleterious influence of adverse weather conditions and non-availability of bee flora all round the year, in a particular locality, have been realized by the researchers/beekeepers and migration concept has been developed to solve this problem. But again, migration itself is not an easy task. The provision of artificial feeding as an alternate of migration. Scientists all over the world have formulated different artificial food recepies for bees on the basis of nutrient composition of honey and pollen, acceptability, palatability, digestibility and affordability of ingredients. This may help to maintain all colony parameters enough to derive maximum advantage of forthcoming floral rich season. However, a standard balanced diet for commercial beekeeping that is accepted worldwide is still awaited.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",1,7.27,191,0,0.5655,0.171875,0.046391753,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"producing honey: there is no competition of bees with other animals, and without bees, these valuable resources could not be harvested. Beekeeping is possible even in the areas where other crops have failed. Any type of land i.e. wild, cultivated, wasteland, mountains and even land-mined areas all have value for beekeeping. Bees get carbohydrates from nectar and protein from pollen; they usually take it after its fermentation, in the form of bee bread. From the history, it has been revealed that honeybees are one of the few insects that is directly beneficial to the mankind. These winged creature and honey they produce find mentioned in many religious epics. In Rigveda, Upanishad and in religious writings, there is description of honey as a valuable and necessary asset Mishra, 1995; Kaushik, 2012.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",2,8.08,130,0,0.3395,0.169230769,0.075757576,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Presently, beekeeping tends to be underplayed in many of the developing countries. The people are adopting beekeeping as ‘a sideline activity’, reason may be the focus towards crop production and livestock rearing or some government schemes, that are providing hands to mouth earning in rural areas. Due to lack of proper training, migration activity, bee enemies and unavailability of market for selling honey, many people are either not adopting beekeeping as full time profession or are getting annoyed towards this venture Bansal et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2016. The efficiency of beekeeping depends upon the richness of bee flora in the vicinity of apiary during different climatic conditions. The richness or availability of bee flora varies in different season of a year in a particular region. The period of year in which flora of bee interest is scarce is known as dearth period. The scarcity of bee flora and insufficient stores of food inside bee colony affects brood rearing, honey production and overall colony growth and development. To get more benefits of beekeeping venture, proper management of honeybee colonies is necessary especially during dearth periods. Success of this small cottage industry depends upon planned bee management technologys. Proper management of honeybee colonies can only be done if beekeepers have in depth knowledge of different management strategies Agrawal, 2014. Management strategies in apiculture have the motive of lift up or improving upon various factors necessary for the colony growth and development. The trouble caused by adverse weather conditions as well as nonavailability of flora all round the year, in a particular locality, have been realized by the researchers and the concept of migration of bee colonies to suitable bee flora rich place has been developed to solve this problem. But again, migration itself is not an easy task, it involves lot of expenses, labour and yet it is not risk-free. It has been observed that even following the concept of migratory beekeeping approximately 40% colonies perished out during scarce period of the year Kumar and Agrawal, 2014. The provision of artificial feeding nectar and pollen substitutes has been considered and developed to maintain egg laying, brood rearing and foraging activities which may maintain enough bee population in the colony.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",2,8.08,369,0,0.992,0.15902965,0.054054054,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"The main source of protein for brood rearing, overall colony development, longevity of adult workers is pollen. The annual pollen requisite of honey bee colonies varies according to the variation in colony location, floral sources and strength of colony. The flora of bee interest is not available in adequate quantity round the year, so provision of pollen substitute and pollen supplements have been tries to maintain the strength of colony by enhancing brood survival and length of adult age Haydak 1935, 1937; Doull, 1980; Saffari et al., 2004. Large number of diets including soybean flour, brewer’s yeast, parched gram, guar meal, skimmed milk powder, egg yolk powder, casein, pea powder, rice bran and fish meal as major ingredients have been formulated and tested on honeybees.

"Mishra et al. 1979 used brewer’s yeast, soybean flour and skimmed milk powder to make moist patties as pollen substitute diet for honey bees. A large number of experiments were conducted on Apis mellifera colonies. After treatment, it was observed that artificial diet stimulates all colony parameters positively; however a satisfactory honey production was also reported in the results. Doull 1980 proposed composition of krayeast and skimmed milk powder as diet for honey bee colonies. The longevity, brood area and foraging activity in the colonies that were fed with pollen supplement found higher than control colonies. A significant increase in honey production was observed in experimental colonies. Black gram has been proposed as a pollen substitute instead of soybean by Abbas et al. 1995. Ten colonies were examined for the period of three months during rainy season in summer i.e. May to July. Four colonies were treated with black gram diet combination, four with soybean meal diet and rest two were without pollen substitute control colonies. Observation revealed that growth of treated colonies found greater in every aspect in comparison to the control colonies. The maximum yield of honey was observed in colonies fed with black gram. Yeast, soybean flour, sugar and small amount of other ingredients was mixed and tested on bee colonies. Positive effect on various colony parameters i.e. brood and honey was observed. Nabors 2000 reported that treated colonies produced more honey in the honey flow season than control colonies.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",2,8.08,243,0,0.652,0.163265306,0.073170732,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"A new pollen substitute diet feed bee has been developed by Saffari et al. 2004 with the composition of natural pollen and of existing supplementary feeds. Feedbee detailed description of ingredient used in diets not given by manufacturer given to treated colonies and compared with natural pollen and Bee-Pro supplementary diet with respect to feed intake, sealed brood area and honey production. Consumption rate of Feedbee was statistically equal to that of natural pollen and superior to Bee-Pro in all treated colonies when feed in moist patty form. Higher honey production observed in both groups feed with natural pollen and feedbee in comparison to Bee-Pro treated colonies and there was no significance difference seen between the honey yield of pollen and Feedbee treated colonies. A study has been conducted to check the effect of early supplementary feeding on honeybee colonies strength Madras-Majewska et al., 2005. Growth and development of colony was assessed on the basis brood area measurements. Two colony groups: Groups I had 10 honeybee colonies fed with candy made with drone brood kept in freezer for 6 month and glucose, Group II consists of 9 colonies fed upon candies made with sugar and honey. Observations revealed that early spring supplementary feeding promotes the overall growth of colony by enhancing the brood area and egg laying by queen.

"rate, brood area and bee population were recorded in a study conducted by Akyol et al. 2006 at East Mediterranean Region. Dastouri et al. 2007 used pea powder, milk powder, soyabean meal and collected pollen to make four different diets for honey bees. Significance difference recorded between the colonies fed with pea powder and other supplements, except the pollen supplement. There was no significance difference found between the pea and pollen supplement treatment. A significant increase was found in the population of colonies treated with pea powder than other colonies treated with milk powder and soyabean meal. An investigation was done to check the effect of supplementary feeding on honey bee colony in Turkey. Five diets were tested on 60 six group of 10 colonies honey bee colonies. Different combinations of diets were: Diet 1 honey and pollen, Diet 2 soya flour, pollen, sucrose and water, Diet 3 yeast, pollen, sucrose and water, and Diet 4 yeast, sucrose, water and soy flour. Diet 1 was found very effective than other treatments as higher increase recorded in the brood area, colony weight, number of frames and honey yield in colonies of group I Dodologlu and Emsen, 2007. Van der Steen 2007 formulated a pollen substitute with easy home preparations and checked their effect on honey bee colony development. In 2001 and 2002 experiments were conducted on free flying honeybee colonies. In the year 2001, three treatments: i pollen substitute ii bee bread and iii no supplement not any pollen supplement given to colony were given to three groups of colonies without any pollen supply with pollen trap. In 2002, material and method was almost same, only bee bread treatment replaced with a pollen supply without pollen trap. Bee longevity, brood rearing and pollination efficacy recorded highest in colonies fed with pollen substitute group had pollen trap. It was concluded that pollen substitute boost up the colonies where deficiency of pollen affects the overall development of colony. Avni et al. 2009 checked the effect of different surface area of pollen supplementary patties fed to Apis mellifera colonies on consumption of diets, brood production and honey production. Four diets were formulated for the study, three pollen supplement diets for experimental colonies and one carbohydrate diet for control colony. Patties of equal weight 300gm but different in size i.e. small 29,200 mm 2 , medium 46,248 mm 2  and large 84,640 mm 2  were fed to Apis mellifera colonies. The data revealed that consumption of large size patties was greatest in most of the colonies followed by colonies fed upon medium and small size patties. Sealed brood area was found highest in the colonies fed with large size patties during the experimental period, whereas, huge fall was recorded in the sealed brood area of control colonies. Honey yield after dearth period, in next flowing season was also better in the colonies fed with large size patties than other treated colonies. Commercially available pollen substitute diets were compared with pollen cake and high fructose corn syrup by means of their consumption, effect on brood and adult population by DeGrandi-Hoffman et al. 2010. Experiments were performed in two different seasons winter and summer for variable durations. In the winter season, three commercially available diet formulations Diet-1, Diet-2 and Diet-3, pollen cakes pollen collected from colonies were tested for three months in the absence of natural pollen intake and two formulations Diet-2 and Diet-3 and pollen cake were given to colonies for two months during summer season with natural pollen intake. Consumption of Diet-2 and Diet-3 was almost similar to the pollen cake in both seasons. Consumption of Diet-1 found less during each feeding interval in first trial. In trial 1, Diet-3 found to be significantly effective on brood rearing and adult bee population than other diets and pollen cake fed to colonies. In trial 2, results brood area and adult bee population of all the colonies fed with artificial diet were similar. It may be the results of natural pollen intake by colonies which fulfilled all the nutritional deficiencies of the colonies and all diets responded equally.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",3,8.08,681,0,1.774,0.130882353,0.077809798,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"Three diet formulations in solid, semi-solid and slurry form developed by using four pulse soybean, Mungbean, pigeon pea and chick pea in India Sihag and Gupta, 2011. Tested colonies were equalized in terms of strength of colony, no pollen stores, sealed brood, unsealed brood and honey stores. Each of four Pollen substitute/supplement was given to set of four colonies directly into frames inside the hive, however control colonies were fed with sugar syrup only. It has been observed that addition of pollen increase the percent acceptability of all diets. Soyabean diet formulation with pollen in slurry form found to be best for all desired aspects including brood area, pollen store, honey area and colony strength among all other three formulations of Mungbean, gram and arhar. Honey yield in next blooming season was found three times more in colonies fed with pollen supplement and two and half times more in colonies fed upon pollen substitute than control colonies. A study has been conducted to check the feeding efficiency of pollen substitute on honey bee colony parameters Sena et al., 2012. 18 colonies two groups of 9 colonies were selected for study and equalize to each other by means of population and queen’s age. It has been reported that feeding the bee colonies with Feedbee, showed a slight increase on the production of honey per colony and brood rearing activity of honey bees. But there was no statistically significance differences found between the control and experimental colonies. Evaluation of protein levels and colony development of Africanized and European honey bees fed with natural and artificial diets Morais et al., 2013. Two artificial protein diets were proposed, a high protein diet made of soy milk powder and albumin, and a lower protein level diet consisting of soy milk powder, brewer’s yeast and rice bran compared with bee bread and a non-protein sucrose diet. Field experiments were conducted on Africanized and European honey bees in two apiaries located at two different places of Brazil. The colonies fed with proteinaceous artificial diets showed significant enhancements in all parameters: percent consumption of formulated diet, colony strength colony weigh and honey production, while overall productivity of control colonies declined during dearth period. Overall observations showed that these two protein diets have better potential to maintain the maximum parameters of colony during dearth period.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",3,8.08,386,0,1.038,0.130769231,0.071611253,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"colonies and least in colonies given with fish meal. A mixture of soybean flour, yeast extract, honey, NaCl salt, vitamins, minerals etc. was used by the Sihag and Gupta 2013 for the formulation of different combinations of four diets. Total 15 colonies were selected for study, 12 colonies for treatment and set of three colonies as control group. All selected colonies were equalized for five colony parameters; sealed brood area, unsealed brood area, bee strength, bee bread area and honey stores. It was reported that colonies receiving diet-4 Soybean flour + Yeast + Honey + vita mins + minerals had significantly more sealed brood, unsealed brood, bee population and honey area than other colonies treated with diet-1, diet-2 and diet-3. However rate of all colony parameter declined gradually in the control colonies. Report showed that none of the control colony survived in dearth period. From this study, it has been revealed that it is necessary to feed honey colonies with pollen substitute or pollen supplement during the scarce period of the year to get the benefits of next honey flowing season Supplemental diets were given on Apis mellifera colonies to check their effect on honey production Mahmood et al., 2013. Pollen, soyabean, grams, maize, brewer’s yeast, and sugar was used to formulate four different combinations which were named as: Soybean diet T 1 , Gram diet T 2 , Maize diet T 3  and Sugar only T 4 . After treatments, in next honey flow season 21.3 kg, 24.4 kg, 19.3 kg and 16 kg honey was extracted from the soyabean diet, gram diet, maize diet and sugar treated colonies respectively.

"Pande and Karnatak 2014 used germinated pulses as pollen substitute for pollen scarce period management of honeybee colonies. Different germinated pulses flour used for the formulation of four different diets viz. ger horse gram, ger chick pea, ger green gram/ Mungbean, ger Pea. All pollen substitute diets affects the colony attributes positively including foraging activity, brood area and honey stores. Colonies fed with germinated chickpea showed significant increase in all parameters including honey store followed by colonies treated with ger green gram and ger horse gram respectively. All the desirable colony attributes were observed to be least in germinated Pea. However, all the colonies treated with pollen substitute diets were found to be superior over control colonies. Kumar and Agrawal 2014 carried out a comparative study to examine the performance of honeybee colonies fed with artificial diets in two different regions of India Gwalior and Panchkula. Defatted soy flour, brewer’s yeast, parched gram, spirulina, skimmed milk powder, sugar, glucose, protein hydrolysate powder and natural pollen were used to develop six different combinations of artificial diet. Trials of diet on colonies have been done during summer dearth period. Among all combinations Diet-3 Defatted soy flour, brewer’s yeast, protein hydrolysate powder, sugar and glucose found to be best for artificial feeding of honeybees. Performance of all experimental colonies was found comparatively better than control colonies. Sealed and unsealed brood, bee population and quantity of honey stores were found higher in the colonies fed formulated diet-3 in comparison to colonies fed with diet1, diet 2, diet 4, diet 5 and diet 6. Impact of supplementary feeding on honey bee brood development and honey production was investigated by Gemeda 2014. Comparison of pea flour and sugar syrup as a supplementary feed of honey bees was done on two groups seven colonies in each group. The results proved that pea flour was better for overall colony growth and maintenance during dearth period and greater honey production. It was reported that after dearth period, in next honey flow season, honey produced from colonies fed with pea flour was found to be comparatively higher than honey produced from colonies fed on sugar syrup.

"honeybee colonies. Experiments were carried out during MarchJune month in the year, 2013 at University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland. 120 bee colonies were divided into five groups. Honey-sugar cake with different additives was given to three groups of colonies Group I: Honey-sugar cake with Beeodine, Group II: Honey-sugar cake with Immunebee solution, Group III: Honey-sugar cake with beetonic solution. Group IV given with Honey-sugar cake without any additive solution and Group V given with honey-sugar cake only. There was no significant difference between the brood areas of all groups. But it was found higher in the colonies group II given with Immunebee solution. Similarly, recorded quantity of honey was not significantly different in all the groups. It was highest in group I given with Beeodine and lowest in the group V no cake and no additives. Abd El-Wahab et al. 2016 carried out a study on honey bee colonies fed with five pollen supplement diets, composed of soybean flour, Brewer’s yeast, powdered sugar, date pollen grains, honey, turmeric, fenugreek powder, vitamins, orange juice, mint oil and sugar syrup. Composition of diet E Brewer’s yeast, bee honey, turmeric, powdered sugar, fenugreek powder, vitamins, orange juice, mint oil and sugar syrup consumed by bee colonies in a higher amount/ 2 weeks interval. No residues of patties left at the end of feeding interval. It was found that honey yield of colonies fed with new pollen substituted diet significantly great in comparison to other tested diets and control. crushed phalaries, soybean, mixed melon and orange shell juice, agwa and cinnamon oil for the formulation two pollen substitute diets Diet B and Diet F for honey bees management during dearth period. Carniolan and Italian hybrid honey bee colonies Apis mellifera were selected for study. Colonies were equalized in terms of no. of frames covered by bees and newly mated queen. Group of three colonies were used for each pollen substitute diet and group of three colonies given with sugar syrup used as a control in the study. Both pollen substitutes fed colonies found to be significantly superior to control colonies in terms of sealed brood area, pollen collection and honey yield. Composition of soybean meal, mesquite pod powder, date paste, Feedbee and corn gluten was used to formulate number of five diets Amro et al., 2016. Palatability and effect of these proteinaceous diets was checked on brood rearing and other quality parameters of honey bee colonies in isolation condition. Composition of diets used in the study as: Diet 1 Soyabean meal, dried skimmed milk, Brewer’s yeast, sugar powder, fresh mixed pollen pellets, honey and water, Diet 2 Mesquite pods powder, dried skim milk, Brewer’s yeast, sugar powder, fresh mixed pollen pellets, honey, multivitamins and minerals, coriander oil and water, Diet 3 Date paste, dried skim milk, Brewer’s yeast, sugar powder, fresh mixed pollen pellets, honey, multivitamins and minerals, coriander oil and water, Diet 4 Feedbee, honey and sucrose solution and water and Diet 5 Corn gluten, sugar powder, fresh mixed pollen pellet, honey and water. Food consumption was significantly highest in the colonies fed with diet 3 213.2 g followed by Feedbee 173.6 g, mesquite 124.1 g, corn gluten 95.7 g and soybean meal 87.4 g respectively. Brood area was largest 1066.7 in the control group free flying condition and lowest values in the experimental group fed with corn gluten.

"Rosov 1944 reported yearly consumption of honey by a colony of honey bee Apis mellifera L. to be 40–45 kg during summer, 20 kg during winter and 6 kg used in wax secretion and a total of about 70 kg. per year. In India, jaggery syrup was found to be readily acceptable to bees as sugar in South India Anonymous, 1951. However, bees do not normally take jaggery, and become dysenteric if they take it due to severe shortage of nectar, particularly in cooler climates and in winter Muttoo, 1947; Mullick, 1948. Bhatia and Pingale 1954 fed small colonies with glucose containing either Agave Veracruz juice, or pure poly-fructosan. Stute 1958 conducted various experiments in Germany by feeding an extract from fresh or dried orange peel to bees after treating it with diphenyl to eliminate its bitterness and observed that the extract sweetened with sugar or honey, which he termed as bee tea, can safely be used as bee food. Free and Spencer- Booth 1961 fed 3 groups of 7 colonies with concentrated and dilute sugar syrup and no syrup during spring, summer and autumn for 3 years. Concentrated sugar syrup was consumed in more quantity than the dilute sugar syrup and it also increased the brood rearing activity to some extent. Farrar 1963 reported that good colonies in most northern regions consume roughly 22–25 kg of honey from the time brood rearing stops in the fall until enough nectar can be collected in the spring to support the colony.

Waller 1972 reported that nectar and sugar solutions containing 30–50 response by honeybees. Nectar is manipulated and enzymatically converted to honey by bees. The colony will perish without honey as energy source, even though large amount of pollen or bee breed may be stored in the combs. Sucrose, glucose and fructose are the predominant sugar in nectar although many more have been identified usually in trace amounts White, 1975. Barker and Lehner 1973 studied the consumption of honey syrup, sucrose and mixed sugar syrup comprising of 13 different sugars by bees. He further reported that consumption of honey syrup and sucrose syrup averaged 23.7 mg and 5.9 mg per bee per day. Finally, they concluded that the bees showed preference for solution with honey over sucrose or mixed sugars. Further, Barker and Lehner found that sucrose was superior to other sugars in both acceptance and nutritive value. Jachimowiez and Ruttner 1974 reported that a mixture containing 70 percent powdered sugar, 15 percent honey and 10 percent invert sugar with 1 small bottle of fumidil ‘B’ per 20 kg of sugar can be fed successfully to strong active colonies as spring stimulative food.

Feeding sugar syrup also resulted in higher survival rate and longer life span in the bees than when fed with other carbohydrate foods Mishra et al., 1984. On the basis of feeding experiments on different types of carbohydrates, Herbert 1992 suggested that the ideal carbohydrate supplement for honey bees is sucrose 2 parts sugar, 1 part water. In spring, a less concentrated solution of sugar containing 1 part sugar to 1 part water is better. Khorvash et al. 1995 in Iran fed the control colonies with white refined sugar and test colonies with various unrefined sugar and obtained satisfactory results even with the unrefined sugar.
