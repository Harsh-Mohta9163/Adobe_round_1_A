"The example below describes Coca-Cola’s repositioning of Mother Energy Drinks: The Coca-Cola Company launched Mother Energy Drinks in 2006 into the Australianhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheCoca-ColaCompany market. The launch campaign was professionally executed, and Coca-Cola was able to leverage its distribution channels to get the product into major retailers. However, the taste of Mother Energy Drink was subpar and repeat purchases were very low. Coca-Cola was faced with a decision: to improve and reposition the product or withdraw it and introduce a new brand and product. The company ultimately decided to reposition the product due to already high brand awareness. The biggest challenge faced by Coca-Cola was to persuade consumers to try the product again. The company changed the packaging, increased the size of the can, and improved the taste of the product. The relaunch of the product featured a new phrase – “New Mother, tastes nothing like the old one.” Ultimately, Coca-Cola was able to successfully reposition Mother Energy Drinks and the brand today competes with the two leading energy drinks in the market – V and Red Bull.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",3,12,176,0,0.4875,0.17679558,0.22459893,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
