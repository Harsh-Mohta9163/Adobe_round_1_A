"Simple Summary: It is well documented in the literature that bees have been facing numerous stressors in recent decades. Although honey bees are well managed worldwide, they have not been unaffected by these challenges. Honey bees are important for pollination in various crops, for the beekeeping sector and for the natural habitats as well. However, to perform this role effectively, they require proper nutrition to support their healthy growth and that of the colony. In the current review, we broadly discuss the basic nutritional needs of honey bees, such as the consumption of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, water, and other essential components. Additionally, we also discuss the use of nutritional supplements aimed at supporting the health and strengthening of the colony, and how, despite these efforts, inadequate nutrition can still be a problem for honey bee colonies.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",1,9.93,140,0,0.389,0.135714286,0.057142857,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"Abstract: Honey bees are known for their wide global distribution, their ease of handling, and their economic and ecological value. However, they are often exposed to a wide variety of stress factors. Therefore, it is essential for beekeepers to maintain healthy bee colonies. In this context, a balanced diet is recommended to support the growth of strong and healthy honey bee colonies. The purpose of this review is therefore to provide an overview of the nutritional requirements of Apis mellifera and their importance for the maintenance of healthy bee colonies. An adequate diet includes the consumption of sufficient amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, water, and essential sterols, and a diet based on multi-floral pollen is desirable. However, when honey bee colonies are located near agroecosystems with lower resource diversity, both brood rearing and colony longevity may decrease, making them more susceptible to parasites and diseases. On the other hand, efforts have been made to improve the health of honey bee colonies with the help of nutritional supplements consisting of a variety of components. Nevertheless, studies have shown that even with these supplements, a lack of nutrients can still be an issue for honey bee colonies. Furthermore, future research should focus on identifying nutritional supplements that can better replicate natural diet diversity and assessing longterm effects on honey bee colony resilience, especially in low-flowering areas. This review discusses the interaction between nutrient requirements and the effects of supplements on colony health.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",1,9.97,244,0,0.6955,0.131147541,0.052845528,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

This species holds significant economic importance by not only increasing production and quality in agricultural fields but also through the commercialization of bee products like apitoxin bee venom, honey, propolis, royal jelly, and wax 3,7.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",2,10.01,100,0,0.273,0.082474227,0.051020408,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.01,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"According to Ilyasov et al.  8 , although there are differences in taxonomic revisions, thirty-three distinct honey bee subspecies are currently found in Europe, Africa, and Western Asia and the Middle East. Moreover, due to the Africanization process resulting from the intercross of European and African subspecies, the hybrid Africanized A. mellifera has also spread throughout the Americas  9, 10 . Depending on the subspecies, honey bees may exhibit less defensive behavior and an enhanced ability to adapt to colder climates, as observed in A. m. carnica  11 , or more defensive behavior, as found in A. m. scutellata  12 , as well as better adaptability to warm environments, as described for A. m. ligustica  13 .

"However, honey bee colony mortality has impacted beekeepers worldwide over the past decades  27 , calling for effective mitigation strategies. Goulson et al.  28  highlighted multiple factors associated with the decline in bees, such as habitat loss, parasites and disease, pesticides, monotonous diets, shipping fever, competition, and climate change. It is currently known that the health risks for honey bees increase when two or more stressors are combined  29 . Nowadays, it is crucial for farmers and beekeepers worldwide to maintain healthy honey bee colonies, especially since these colonies are often exposed to stressors and are frequently located near agroecosystems and natural forest areas 30.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",2,9.98,105,0,0.299,0.174757282,0.038834951,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.05,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Winkler et al.  31  reported that global land use has increased more than previously estimated in recent decades, which may be linked to global trade in agricultural production. Similarly, large-scale monoculture has negatively impacted apiculture by reducing honey yield, as described by de Groot et al.  32 . As mentioned before, monotonous diets are one of the stress factors for bees, and honey bees are highly dependent on the availability and diversity of floral resources, which are crucial for the development and survival of their colonies  33 . This combination of diverse floral sources is important because, depending on the species, these sources can vary in protein, amino acid, lipid, carbohydrates, vitamins, and other nutritional contents  34 . Concerns about honey bees receiving an inadequate diet have driven the development of protein supplements, and efforts have been made to study the effectiveness of these supplements on colony health  35 – 37 . Brodschneider and Crailsheim  34  suggested that a balanced diet is necessary to maintain well-fed and healthy colonies. Similarly, queens, workers, and drones have different physiology and nutritional demands during their development and throughout their lives  38 , which further highlights the importance of nutritional diversity.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",2,10,197,0,0.55,0.145833333,0.046632124,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.09,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"Pollen is the main source of protein for honey bees, which they collect from a wide variety of plants  3 . Studies have shown that the protein content of pollen varies depending on the plant species  42 . Radev  43  determined the crude protein content in mixed pollen species collected during different harvesting periods April to September in Bulgaria and found a range of 11.5% to 27.4%, while a literature review by Roulston et al.  44  found a wider range of protein content from 2.5% to 61% in the pollen of 377 plant species from 93 plant families. In this regard, the quality and diversity of pollen are important for honey bee physiology and health  33 , as the protein content and amino acid profile can vary, and a lack of pollen diversity can impair development and leave the colony more susceptible to pathogens and diseases  45 . A diet consisting of multi-flower pollen is preferable  46 , as balanced nutrition more effectively ensures the proper growth, development, and overall health of honey bee colonies.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",3,9.96,175,0,0.421,0.111764706,0.051724138,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"The amount of pollen collected by a honey bee colony can be influenced by different factors, including climatic conditions, season, colony size, health status, and the availability and diversity of floral sources  47, 48 , which also affect protein levels in the colony. Wille et al.  49  described a range of 10–26 kg of pollen collected per year, whereas Avni et al.  50 reported 16.8 kg of pollen per colony as an overall annual mean, with the variations depending on sites and seasons. However, higher values, with pollen collection reaching up to 55 kg per year, have already been reported in the literature  51 . The nutritional value of pollen is a valuable source of amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, and essential sterols  52 . These components are closely linked to the growth, reproduction, and productivity of A. mellifera colonies  53 . According to Radev  54 , honey bee colony reproduction increases in the presence of pollen with high protein content, specifically over 21 and 27%. In contrast, if pollen access is reduced, brood rearing and colony lifespan may decrease 55.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",3,9.95,182,0,0.4615,0.118644068,0.055865922,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.02,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"The protein requirements of adult bees and honey bees’ larvae are different. A study by Crailsheim et al.  56  showed that the daily pollen consumption of an adult honey bee was 3.4–5.4 mg, depending on age, while the entire colony consumed between 13.4 and 17.8 kg of pollen annually. In contrast, Hrassnigg and Crailsheim  38  emphasized that larvae require a higher protein intake and need to consume 25–37.5 mg per reared larva 125–187.5 mg of pollen with a protein content of about 20%. According to Li et al.  57 , a higher protein content in the larval diet can increase worker longevity, possibly due to the upregulation of genes related to antioxidant activity. A pollen-based diet is also associated with lower sensitivity to pesticides  58 . In addition, honey bees use pollen to make bee bread, a food consisting of a mixture of pollen, regurgitated nectar, and enzymes secreted by their glands  59 . Bee bread provides energy, has a higher nutritional value than pollen, and contains bioactive compounds such as phenolics and flavonoids, which exhibit antioxidant and antimicrobial activity  59, 60 .

"The use of protein-supplemented diets in honey bee colonies has increased among beekeepers worldwide in recent years  37, 61 . DeGrandi-Hoffman et al.  62  observed that a commercial diet with 16.5% protein and 66% carbohydrate can stimulate the production of more brood. According to Zheng et al.  63 , the reproduction rate of honey bees was maximized when they were fed with a crude protein content of 29.5–34.0%. Liquid protein supplementation Hydroamin 30 ® —Bioal diluted at 4% in one liter of sucrose–water syrup 2:1 m/v improved bee health and decreased post-winter mortality, as highlighted by García-Vicente et al.  64 . Given these findings, beekeepers should consider adding protein supplements to the diet during pollen shortages. On the other hand, DeGrandi-Hoffman et al.  65  demonstrated that natural forage was more effective than protein supplements in reducing pathogen load and resulted in higher over-winter survival, which was related to the greater digestion of pollen proteins. The authors suggest that the protein supplements were less digestible than pollen because the protein sources soy, barley flour, and eggs are not part of the bees’ diet. However, additional research is required to evaluate the effects of supplemented protein diets. Furthermore, bees are no longer finding the same resources that were available to them in previous years, which is why fructose and sucrose syrups are being more widely used. Studies have reported the impacts of these changes on bee nutrition and health 66,67.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",4,9.96,238,0,0.6425,0.169491525,0.072580645,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"Lipids are essential for physiological processes related to energy, metabolism, and regulation  96 . They serve as a significant energy source for honey bees, store energy reserves, and are key components of cell membrane structures  96, 97 . Lipids are primarily stored in the fat body, with larvae having a greater amount of lipids compared to adult honey bees  98 . However, studies have also shown that young nurse bees store a large amount of lipids in their abdomens  99, 100 . Conversely, the amount of abdominal lipids decreases with age 101, which could be related to foraging activity.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",5,10.01,99,0,0.2465,0.178947368,0.052631579,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"In addition, fatty acids are also important for honey bees and contribute to antimicrobial properties, cognitive functions, and reproduction  52, 100, 102 . Palmitic acid, linoleic acid omega-6, and alpha-linolenic acid omega-3 are the most commonly found fatty acids in pollen  102 , and together with oleic acid, they are also present in the body lipids of drones, workers, and queens 103.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",5,10.01,62,0,0.164,0.083333333,0.031746032,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.07,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Compared to other types of dietary supplementations, there are few studies on the use of lipid diets. Nonetheless, research has demonstrated that brood production in honey bees increases when lipid extracts e.g., pollen lipid fraction are included in their diet  104, 105 . According to Arien et al.  105 , brood rearing was best with an 8% lipid diet, while survival was highest with a 4% lipid diet and an omega-6:3 ratio of 1.

Pollen is a valuable source of amino acids, especially exogenous ones  110 . According to De Groot  111 , the amino acids arginine, histidine, lysine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, and valine are essential for the development of adult honey bee workers.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",6,9.99,89,0,0.2495,0.084337349,0.060240964,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.03,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

The composition of RJ includes water, proteins, free amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and minerals  114 . According to Howe et al.  115 , RJ contains 17 amino acids and five unidentified ninhydrinpositive compounds. On the other hand, Liming et al.  116  determined 26 amino acids in RJ.

"Both amino acids and vitamins have been used as food supplements for honey bees  117 – 119 . Glavinic et al.  118  demonstrated that newly emerged worker bees fed a diet supplemented with a combination of vitamins, minerals, and amino acids had a significantly reduced number of Nosema spores compared to the control, particularly on day 12 post-infection. This effect was observed in the context of immunosuppression induced by the microsporidium Nosema ceranae .

"In addition to the nutrient requirements described above, water is also essential for the survival of honey bees. According to Nicolson  120 , bees use water not only to maintain osmotic homeostasis but also for several other tasks within the hive, such as cooling the brood area, regulating the hive temperature, and feeding the larval brood, due to the high water content in RJ. Moreover, water can also provide minerals to bees  121 . Mineral nutrients such as sodium Na, magnesium Mg, and potassium K are essential to meet the nutritional needs of bees  122, 123 .

"Considering all the nutritional requirements of A. mellifera, including the need for a well-balanced diet, along with the challenges posed by proximity to agricultural crops and exposure to various stressors, maintaining healthy honey bee colonies has become more challenging for beekeepers. As a result, in response to the demand for stronger and more productive colonies, the use of dietary supplementation in beekeeping practices is becoming more common worldwide, especially because the availability of resources is not always possible. Additionally, decisions regarding food supplementation factors, such as landscape use, climatic conditions, seasonal variations, and the presence of environmental stressors, should be considered, to optimize colony health and productivity. Further research needs to be conducted in order to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of food supplementation on honey bee colonies.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",7,9.97,127,0,0.3945,0.133858268,0.03875969,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0.09,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
