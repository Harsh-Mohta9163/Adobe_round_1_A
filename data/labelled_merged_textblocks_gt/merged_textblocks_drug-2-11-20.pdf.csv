"Similar to drug?target interaction prediction discussed in the previous section, many early approaches to DDI prediction primarily utilized drug?drug interaction graphs, where nodes represent drugs and edges encode their interactions. With advancements in the field, more recent methods have begun to incorporate drug molecular structures, represented as molecular graphs as introduced previously, in which nodes denote atoms and edges correspond to chemical bonds. In both types of graphs, nodes and edges are typically enriched with additional features or attributes that capture relevant properties. For example, in drug?drug interaction graphs, node attributes may encode drug-specific properties, while edges can be labeled to indicate interaction types e.g., synergistic or antagonistic effects. In molecular graphs, node features represent atomic properties, and edge features describe bond characteristics. GNN-based models are capable of processing both graph types, often alongside auxiliary information such as drug similarity matrices, to learn latent representations from different perspectives and at multiple levels?capturing both relational patterns in drug interaction networks and structural characteristics at molecular and sub-molecular scales.

"The choice of input data and their representations not only inspires model design but also significantly influences problem formulations. Early models primarily focused on drug?drug interaction graphs combined with simple node-level drug features.

Building on this idea, models such as GCNMK 36 further decomposed the DDI graph into two separate graphs, one representing interactions where a drug increases the activity of another, and the other where it decreases activity, and applied two GNNs to learn drug representations from these differentiated views. Subsequent studies expanded the input space by incorporating drug molecular graphs, thereby enabling the integration of both structural and relational perspectives to enhance model performance. For instance, MRCGNN 39 employed a GNN to process the relational DDI graph while enriching each drug?s feature representation with molecular-level information extracted by a separate GNN operating on its molecular graph.

To assess the binding affinity of small-molecule ligands to their targets, ChEMBL primarily uses experimental bioactivity data extracted from scientific literature. To facilitate comparison and analysis, data from different sources undergoes a standardization process so that measurement type, value, and units are comparable. In addition to binding affinity measurements, ChEMBL also contains rich information about compounds, targets, experimental assays, and original sources. The current release of ChEMBL release 35 includes approximately 2.5 million distinct compounds and 21.1 million bioactivity measurements derived from 1.7 million biological assays across 16,000 biomolecular targets. ChEMBL supports a wide range of applications, including structure?activity relationship analysis, off-target prediction, and drug repurposing. Its datasets are available via web interfaces, APIs, and bulk downloads under open Creative Commons licenses.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",9,9.96,136,0,0.457,0.11029411764705882,0.09027777777777778,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"PDBbind Dataset 126 was created to collect experimentally measured binding data from literature for the biomolecular complexes with high-resolution 3D structures in the Protein Data Bank PDB. It provides an essential linkage between the energetic and structural information of those complexes, which is helpful for various computational and statistical studies on docking validation, scoring-function development, affinity prediction, molecular recognition, and drug discovery. The most recent version 2024 was released on a commercial platform called PDBbind+ with a free demo version. It currently contains experimental binding affinity data for 27,385 protein-ligand complex, 4,594 protein-protein complex, 1.440 protein-nucleic acid complex and 234 nucleic acid-ligand complex.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",10,9.96,103,0,0.3395,0.1262135922330097,0.08928571428571429,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Metz Dataset 123 focused exclusively on kinase inhibition activities. It contains over 150,000 kinase inhibitory measurements, comprising more than 3,800 compounds tested against 172 different protein kinases. Based on these measurements, the authors constructed a comprehensive kinome interaction network, enabling systematic analysis of kinase?inhibitor interactions.

"Davis Dataset 125 was developed by Davis et al. to provide a broad target panel covering over 80% of the human catalytic kinome. It includes selectivity profiles of 72 kinase inhibitors tested against 442 human kinases. With more than 30,000 high-precision measurements obtained from a standardized binding assay, the dataset supports various tasks such as binding affinity prediction, selectivity profiling, off-target prediction, and regression model validation. The uniform experimental design and extensive kinase coverage make the dataset a preferred benchmark for visually screening compound libraries and identifying novel inhibitors.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",10,9.96,89,0,0.2765,0.1348314606741573,0.06521739130434782,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Via a systematic evaluation of target selectivity profiles across three different biochemical assays of kinase inhibitors, Tang et al. 124 introduced a model-based approach and a unified affinity metric known as the ?KIBA score?, to integrate complementary information captured by different bioactivity types. The resulting KIBA Dataset comprises a drug?target bioactivity matrix involving 52,498 chemical compounds and 467 kinase targets, with a total of 246,088 KIBA scores. This statistically harmonized dataset, designed to minimize experimental variability, has become a widely used benchmark for training machine learning models in drug?target affinity prediction.","[0, 0, 100, 20]",10,9.96,91,0,0.29,0.17582417582417584,0.08333333333333333,0,0,-20,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"While comprehensive resources such as DrugBank include DDI information, they often require additional processing to extract pure interaction data. Furthermore, they may not include all the measurements from high-throughput screening assays, for example, dose responses for different dose combinations of drug pairs.
