# **Part 1: Administrative information** **Application form** **USER GUIDE FOR THE ELECTRONIC** **APPLICATION FORM FOR A MARKETING** **AUTHORISATION (Veterinary)** **June 2015**

Version 1.0


## **PURPOSE AND GENERAL RULES**

This user guide has been prepared in order to facilitate the work of applicants when completing the electronic
application form as part of an application for a marketing authorisation / extension of a medicinal product for
veterinary use.

_**How to fill in the electronic**_ _**application form?**_


The electronic application form has been prepared to be filled in by the applicant in case of an application made
either by national route or by mutual recognition, decentralised or centralised procedures.

In the case of a mutual recognition or decentralised procedure an application form should be filled in for all
competent authorities where the application is made.
Since some information may differ between Member States (e.g. name of the product, marketing authorisation
holder (MAH), legal status, contact persons etc…), the appropriate sections should be replicated where
necessary. Fields can be duplicated by clicking on a boxed “+” symbol. For relevant sections, the applicant is
requested to specify to which Member State the information relates.

Where EEA is indicated in the application form, the applicant should understand EEA countries therefore
including EU countries.
For national, mutual recognition and decentralised procedures, a completed separate application form is usually
required for each strength and pharmaceutical form. For centralised procedures a combined application form for
all strengths and pharmaceutical forms is recommended, the relevant sections should be replicated as necessary.

Fields relevant for certain types of applications or related to legal basis do only appear after ticking the

concerned box.

Square boxes indicate that multiple choices are possible while round boxes indicate that one choice excludes
the other possibilities.

Some fields have to be filled in by choosing a value from a drop-down list that is based on a controlled
dictionary. Further information on the dictionaries used is provided in this document.

[The e-submissions website (http://esubmission.ema.europa.eu/eaf/index.html) provides further guidance on:](http://esubmission.ema.europa.eu/eaf/index.html)

- Technical aspects of the electronic application form, in particular the technical user guide and Questions &
Answers documents relating to practical and technical aspects of the electronic Application Forms;

- Information on the dictionaries, including instructions on requesting additional terms to some of the lists.


_**Which language should be used?**_


- English should be used for a centralised procedure.

- English should be used for a mutual recognition or decentralised procedures, except in some
Member States where the national language should be used. - National language should be used preferably in
the case of a national application, except if subsequent mutual recognition procedure is already considered and
if the national competent authority where this application is made accepts English.
Language requirements apply also to the annexes to the application form therefore, as applicable, translations
may have to be provided.

## **1. TYPE OF APPLICATION**


**1.1 This application concerns**


_**1.1.1. A Centralised procedure**_

Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 defines the eligibility of applications for evaluation under the
centralised procedure through which medicinal products must or may be authorised by the Union. The
eligibility to centralised procedure should be confirmed by the CVMP well in advance of the submission of the
application for the marketing authorisation.

The basis for eligibility should be indicated in line with the CVMP acceptance/confirmation of the eligibility to
the centralised procedure, indicating also the date of acceptance/confirmation of eligibility. Only one eligibility
basis should be indicated. If the product falls under ‘mandatory’ eligibility scope, this scope should be
indicated, even if the product falls also under an ‘optional’ scope.

The rapporteur and co-rapporteur appointed by the CVMP should be indicated in this section (Title, First name,

Surname).

For further guidance on the procedure for confirmation of eligibility to centralised procedure and rapporteur
appointment please refer to the website of European Medicines Agency

[&mid=).](http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/landing/veterinary_medicines_regulatory.jsp&mid=)


_**1.1.2. A Mutual recognition procedure**_

The applicant should indicate the reference Member State, details of the marketing authorisation (date of
authorisation and marketing authorisation number), procedure number, and for each “wave” of mutual
recognition procedure concerned Member State(s) and the proposed (or agreed) common renewal date.

The procedure number is the Mutual Recognition Procedure number allocated by the reference Member State.

“First Use” means the first mutual recognition procedure.
All the concerned Member States should be indicated (by replication of the box).

“Repeat use” means a new use (“wave”) of the same mutual recognition or decentralised procedure made to
include new concerned Member State(s).

When applying for a repeat use, the applicant should complete “first use/wave” by stating the Member States
which have recognised the marketing authorisation during the first use (or during the decentralised procedure)
and complete, when necessary, section 4.2 indicating the Member States where the application has (have) been
withdrawn during the “first use/wave”. For each subsequent use the applicant should indicate the rank (2nd,
third, fourth…) and states the Member States which have recognised the marketing authorisation during the
first use/wave and subsequent finalised use of the procedure. Last “wave” should reflect the current application.

Further information on previous applications should be provided in section 4 of the application.


_**1.1.3. A Decentralised procedure**_

The applicant should indicate the reference Member State, procedure number allocated by the RMS, and
concerned Member State(s) and proposed common renewal date.
For repeat-use of decentralised procedure, please complete section 1.1.2.


_**1.1.4. A National procedure**_

The Member State in which the application is made should be mentioned. Optionally procedure number
allocated prior to the submission should be indicated.


**1.2. Application for a change to existing marketing authorisation leading to an extension**
**as referred to in Annex I of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, or any national**
**legislation, where applicable**

Certain changes to a marketing authorisation are considered to fundamentally alter the terms of a marketing
authorisation and therefore cannot be considered as a variation. For these changes, set out in Annex I of
Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, a new application must be made that shall be evaluated in accordance with the
same procedure as for the initial marketing authorisation to which it relates.
Applications for changes or additions falling under the scope of Annex I of Commission Regulation (EC) No
1234/2008 (“extension application”) can only be submitted by the marketing authorisation holder. In this case,
the applicant must be the same as the marketing authorisation holder of the existing marketing authorisation.
Reference should be made to the following guidance:

[http://www.hma.eu/uploads/media/063_Q_A_Referring_to_data_in_another_dossier_EMA-CMDv-](http://www.hma.eu/uploads/media/063_Q_A_Referring_to_data_in_another_dossier_EMA-CMDv-69345-2011.pdf)
[69345-2011.pdf](http://www.hma.eu/uploads/media/063_Q_A_Referring_to_data_in_another_dossier_EMA-CMDv-69345-2011.pdf)
The same procedure should be followed, not the same legal basis.


_**1.2.1 Changes applied for**_

The applicant should specify which of the changes set out in Annex I of Commission Regulation (EC) No
1234/2008 this application concerns:


   a qualitative change in declared active substance not defined as a new active substance (indicating
the type of change),

   change in bioavailability,

   change in pharmacokinetics,

   change or addition of a new strength/potency,

   change or addition of a new pharmaceutical form,

   change or addition of a new route of administration

   change or addition of a food-producing target animal species

Multiple concomitant changes are possible in a single application form if applied for at the same time. All
changes applied for should be indicated, therefore all relevant boxes should be ticked (e.g. change of
pharmaceutical form and change of strength).
The European Commission has published a guideline to clarify the terms 'pharmaceutical form' and 'strength'
and to include relevant examples for this classification: [Guideline on the categorisation of new applications](http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-2/c/v2c_ea_v__10_2003_en.pdf)
[versus variation applications.](http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-2/c/v2c_ea_v__10_2003_en.pdf)
