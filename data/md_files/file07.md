INTERLEAVING AND LANGUAGE LEARNING 2


Abstract


Interleaving, a learning technique which involves practicing on multiple skills in parallel, goes


against the standard method of blocking (or blocked training) that is common in schools and in


many types of implicit skill training (for example, practicing a sport). While blocked training is


convenient for many learners, several previous studies have shown that interleaving can yield


statistically significant advantages in learning and in improving memory over blocking. The


present study explored the effects of interleaving versus blocked training for learning Spanish


verb conjugation skills. Participants with many different language backgrounds (excepting


Spanish) learned to conjugate verbs in the Spanish imperfect and preterite tenses in either a


blocked format or interleaved format (in a between-subjects design). After a one-week delay, a


verb conjugation test was administered. On average, participants learned Spanish verb


conjugation skills better if they had been trained using interleaving. This result suggests that


interleaving can be beneficial for foreign language learning.

The Effects of Interleaving Versus Blocking for


Learning to Conjugate Verbs in the Spanish Language





For over a decade, learning scientists have compared the effects of learning one skill or


topic at a time (blocking or blocked training) against a technique in which two or more skills are


learned simultaneously by switching back and forth between them (interleaving or interleaved


training). Some studies have found benefits of interleaving and others have found benefits to


blocking. For instance, interleaving benefits have been observed for learning algebraic rules


(e.g., Mayfield & Chase, 2002) and geometric concepts (e.g., Taylor & Rohrer, 2010), whereas


blocking benefits have been observed for learning to identify degrees of varying line segments


(e.g., Goldstone, 1996) and French pronunciation rules (e.g., Carpenter & Mueller, 2013).


Most schools implement blocking for a variety of topics because classes typically do not


have enough time during the day to get through entire lesson plans. The use of blocked


scheduling, wherein only one skill or concept is covered at one time, alleviates these types of


problems. Other reasons include the fact that it is easier for both teachers and students to use


blocking because it involves simpler schedules. But is this type of training method optimal for


learning, and more importantly, does it yield better retention of learned information and skills


To date, there has been little evidence of benefits of interleaving for language learning,


relative to blocking. Specifically, in an experiment where English-speaking participants learned


French pronunciation rules (e.g., Carpenter and Mueller, 2013), practice occurred in blocked or


interleaved format and was immediately followed by a final test. Performance was better after


blocked training. However, that study measured the direct and immediate retention of learned


information and not necessarily the information that would still be remembered after participants


INTERLEAVING AND LANGUAGE LEARNING 4


were able to spend time doing other everyday tasks. By contrast, in the present study, which


examined the use of blocked or interleaved training for learning Spanish verb conjugation skills


(i.e., a type of grammar), such time was given by forcing participants to wait a week before


another practice session and another week before testing measures were conducted. This was


implemented to ensure that participants were retaining learned information in long-term memory


over an extended period and not just immediately after exposure. The differences between


blocked learning and interleaving were then measured and compared between subjects after the


testing session to see which yielded better learning and memory of that learning.



**Method**





**Participants**



Ninety-six participants with no prior Spanish experience whatsoever participated in order


to earn experimental credit for psychology classes taken at the University of California, San


Diego. Forty-one participants were randomly assigned into the blocked learning group and 47


participants were randomly assigned into the interleaved learning group. About half were native


English speakers and the remainder spoke a variety of different languages.


The experiment was split into three sessions that consisted of two learning sessions


followed by a testing session. Each session was separated by exactly one week (7 days) of time.


Across both sessions, participants in the blocked and interleaved learning groups learned to


conjugate verbs in the Spanish preterite and imperfect tenses. Across both groups, assignment of


tense (preterite or imperfect) to the first or second sessions was counterbalanced, some


participants had learned the imperfect rules first and preterite rules second, while others had


learned the reverse order.

**Materials**


The materials included four rules each for the preterite and imperfect tenses, written as


single sentences in English; three rules for each tense which describe conjugating verbs paired


with the ‘I’, ‘you’, and ‘we’ forms of Spanish pronouns; three example sentences in English and


Spanish for each of those rules; 32 short answer fill-in-the-blank practice questions in English


and Spanish; and 30 multiple-choice final test questions in English and Spanish, with six answer


choices each. All materials were shown in English and accompanied by their exact Spanish


translations.


**Procedure**


During the first session, participants began by reading instructions on a computer screen


informing them that they would be learning to conjugate verbs in the Spanish language. For


participants assigned to the blocked learning group, the first session was spent learning to


conjugate verbs in one tense only. For example, in the first session, the rules for conjugating


verbs in the preterite tense were shown. Participants then learned to conjugate verbs paired with


the ‘I’, ‘you’, and ‘we’ forms of Spanish pronouns in the preterite tense and with respect to three


different verbs each. They then practiced conjugating verbs in the preterite tense by completing


16 short answer fill-in-the-blank practice trials. On each trial, after an answer was typed, the


correct answer was shown. After the practice trials were finished, the first session concluded. A


week later during the second session, the process was repeated for the imperfect tense.


At the end of each learning session, participants were asked two questions in a survey.


The first question asked them to rate how difficult it was for them to learn Spanish conjugation


that day. The possible ratings were available on a 5-point scale ranging from ‘Very Easy’ to


‘Very Difficult’. The second question asked them to judge how well they thought they had


INTERLEAVING AND LANGUAGE LEARNING 6


learned Spanish verb conjugation skills during that session. The possible ratings were also


available on a 5-point scale, this time ranging from ‘Excellent’ to ‘Poor’.


For participants assigned to the interleaved learning group, the preterite and imperfect


rules were both presented as the first session began. After the rules were shown, participants


learned to conjugate verbs paired with the ‘I’, ‘you’, and ‘we’ pronouns for both the preterite and


imperfect tenses. They then practice conjugating verbs in both tenses by completing 16 short


answer fill-in-the-blank practice trials. After the practice trials were finished, the first session


concluded. Critically, participants were exposed to both the preterite and imperfect tenses,


unlike the participants in the blocked learning group. During the second session, the participants


again practiced conjugating verbs in preterite and imperfect tenses. Thus, during this session,


participants were re-exposed to both tenses. After each learning session was concluded,


participants were asked the same two questions as the participants in the blocked learning group.


Both questions also had the same available responses as the ones mentioned before.


In the final session, all participants were tested on how well they learned and


remembered to conjugate verbs in both tenses. This test consisted of 30 multiple-choice


questions wherein they had to choose one of six verbs with the correct pronoun as well as form


of the pronoun. After this testing block, the experiment ended and results were measured.


**Results**


Test results were analyzed for both the blocked and interleaved learning groups after both


groups had concluded the same test. Figure 1 shows the proportion of correct responses on the


multiple-choice test in both groups. As shown, the interleaved learning group answered


correctly 64% of the time whereas participants in the blocked learning group answered correctly


at rate of 52%. This shows that participants in the interleaved learning group answered verb


INTERLEAVING AND LANGUAGE LEARNING 7


conjugation questions more accurately than participants in the blocked learning group.


At the end of each learning session, participants in both groups were asked the question,


“How difficult was it to learn Spanish conjugation today?”. Figure 2 shows that the answers


‘Very Easy’ and ‘Easy’ were chosen more often in both learning sessions in the blocked learning


group compared to the interleaved learning group in response to how difficult it was for them to


learn verb conjugation skills. In contrast, the answers ‘Very Difficult’ and ‘Somewhat Difficult’


were chosen more often in both learning sessions in the interleaved learning group compared to


the blocked learning group.


Again at the end of each session, a second survey question was asked. This question was,


“How well do you believe you learned Spanish conjugation today?". Figure 3 shows


participants’ responses to this question. The results show that the answers ‘Excellent’ and


‘Good’ were chosen more often in both learning sessions in the blocked learning group


compared to the interleaved learning group. In contrast, the answers ‘Poor’ and ‘Fair’ were


chosen more often in both learning sessions in the interleaved learning group compared to the


blocked learning group.


**Discussion**


Previous studies have shown that blocked learning can yield better results compared to


interleaving, including for language learning. However, such experiments (e.g., Carpenter &


Mueller, 2013) have not tested the long-term effect of interleaving. As such, the finding that


blocked learning sometimes yields better results may reflect recent exposure to practice. Indeed,


the present study demonstrated that interleaving has benefits for language learning when such


learning is measured after a delay as compared to right away. When participants learned both


tenses in session one and were then able to re-practice those tenses during a second session,


INTERLEAVING AND LANGUAGE LEARNING 8


results were much better compared to learning one tense in the first session and then learning a


new tense in the second session. This indicates that participants in the interleaved learning group


were able to more fully learn the rules of when to use the imperfect and preterite tenses and what


those tenses corresponded to in the Spanish language, vs. the blocked learning group. In both


groups however, there was learning being accomplished. On the final test, since there were six


possible multiple-choice responses per question, a chance rate would be 16.66% of responding


correctly, and both groups scored on average substantially better than that.


**Why Interleaving Improved Language Learning**


It seems unintuitive that the participants who did better on the final test, namely those in


the interleaved learning group, thought that the material was more difficult to learn as compared


to the blocked learning group. It would seem logical to think that if participants thought material


was easier to learn, then they would perform better on the final test than individuals who thought


the material was hard to learn. However, a major theoretical explanation for the benefits of


interleaving is that it strengthens memory associations by changing the solution to the practice


problem with each attempt (Rohrer, 2012). That is, because of the switching between different


skills or concepts that occurs during interleaving, the solution to any given practice problem is


not the same as the previous problem. This makes with using interleaving seem difficult. By


contrast, if the practice problems in a single session have the same pathway to get to a similar


solution each and every time, as occurs during blocking, then answering such problems seems


much easier. However, this method is less effective at strengthening memory associations.


Thus, in this case, the easier method of training does not yield better learning.


How exactly might interleaving strengthen memory associations? One possibility is that


the brain requires a higher level of functioning during interleaved learning as compared to


INTERLEAVING AND LANGUAGE LEARNING 9


blocked learning. By having to answer using different responses, the brain is engaged in the


materials all the way through a learning session. In the current study, as the learning session


continued, this process was likely repeated over and over again, and in doing so, it reinforced


neuronal connections in the brain associated with responding in a correct manner to the proper


Spanish verb conjugation rules. By contrast, under blocked training, participants are responding


in the same way each and every time. Their short-term memory is sufficient to answer questions


and it seems easier as compared to the interleaved learning group, but less long-term learning


occurs as a result.


Another possibility is that participants in the blocked learning group were only learning


to conjugate verbs for a particular tense instead of learning both tenses and the rules for when to


use one tense over another in a proper sentence (as the interleaving participants learned to do).


As such, in addition to not adequately learning how to use the two particular tenses by


themselves, participants in the blocked learning group probably did not adequately learn how to


discriminate between them.


The logic behind these explanations reappear when participants are asked how well they


thought that they learned the material. After participants in the blocked learning group finished a


training session, they usually had a higher tendency to think that they had learned the material


well than participants in the interleaved learning group because the material was easier to learn.


This is likely because of the fact that as they were moving through a learning session, they were


providing the same types of responses over and over again repeatedly (and executing the same


type of response yields a higher chance of being correct). But this type of responding is


redundant. Overall, participants in the blocked learning group thought that they had learned the


material better, but they actually did not.


INTERLEAVING AND LANGUAGE LEARNING 10


**Study Implications**


Overall, many learning techniques seem to be easier for people, but this does not always


mean that they yield better results. When a learning process is more difficult, it can mean that


there was an increase in effort during learning (as long as the participants actually tried learning


to the best of their ability). This can indicate that the brain has higher levels of activation


throughout the cortex and that neuronal connections associated with learning occur more often as


compared to a learning process that seems easy.


Everyday, people try to better themselves by learning a particular skill, language, or


subject of interest. The present study suggests that the time that is needed to learn and relearn


materials can be drastically reduced, and the chance of long-lasting learning improved, if people


learn the material through a process of interleaving instead of blocking. If these results are true,


and hold true in other areas of learning, then academic success in schools could be heightened as


with post-graduate research, skills such as learning a sport or a particular type of medical


procedure could be learned quicker and with higher success, and learning different languages


could be faster and with longer-lasting effects. The possibility for higher academic achievement


as well as other successes has vast implications that this world has yet to even imagine.


However, at present more studies need to be conducted and end with the same conclusion in


order to generalize these results to the world population. Interleaving also needs to be


investigated for different types of materials in order to determine whether it has similar dramatic


effects on teaching and learning.
