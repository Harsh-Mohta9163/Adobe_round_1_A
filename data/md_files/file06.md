**Abstract**


Cupping therapy is a simple, effective and economic treatment. Cupping therapy is a formal treatment in Chinese
hospitals and in some European countries. Here, we review history of wet cupping therapy and its two distinct
methodologies. First method is puncturing and cupping (PC) method that includes five steps: skin demarcation,
sterilization, puncturing, cupping and sterilization. Second method is cupping, puncturing and cupping (CPC) method
that includes six steps: skin demarcation, sterilization, first cupping, puncturing, second cupping and sterilization.
CPC method predominates in the Arabic world, while PC method has a worldwide distribution. We report here that
our detailed evidence-based analysis of both methods reveals many novel advantages in the CPC method over the
PC method. CPC method has a better analgesic effect and benefits more from the viscoelastic nature of the skin.
During the first cupping step in the CPC method (not present in the PC method), a fluid mixture containing causative
pathological substances (CPS) is collected inside skin uplifting due to the effect of negative pressure of sucking
cups. CPS differs from disease to disease according to disease etiology and pathogenesis. That fluid mixture
contains collected interstitial fluids with CPS, filtered fluids (from blood capillaries) with CPS, hemolyzed blood cells
(hemolysed RBCs, WBCs and platelets). That fluid mixture does not contain intact blood cells as their sizes are much
bigger than sizes of pores of skin capillaries and cannot be filtered. The fluid mixture is totally excreted in next steps.
We review here that wet cupping therapy is a highly recommended treatment in prophetic medicine, medicine related
to Prophet Mohammad peace be upon him who said: “The best among what you use in therapy is Al-hijamah (CPC
method of wet cupping therapy)”.


In conclusion, CPC method is better than PC method in clearing blood and interstitial spaces from CPS.
Standardization of methodologies of cupping therapy seems essential to gain optimal outcomes.

**Introduction**


Cupping therapy is a simple procedure in which negative pressure
is applied to the skin through sucking cups (dry cupping therapy) [1].
Many types of cupping therapy are described in the literature including
dry cupping therapy, wet cupping therapy, medicinal cupping therapy,
moving cupping therapy and others [2]. The most important type of
wet cupping therapy seems to be Al-hijamah (method of wet cupping
therapy practiced in prophetic medicine). Unlike most conventional
treatment modalities, wet cupping therapy is an excretory form of
therapy not an introductory one i.e. wet cupping therapy uses negative
pressure suctioning and skin pricking to open the skin barrier and
excrete a bloody mixture of fluids with soluble wastes and causative
pathological substances (CPS). Second negative pressure suctioning
completes the process of waste excretion. Unfortunately, medical
research related to cupping therapy does not cover its importance.
Cupping therapy is practiced officially in hospitals in China [3] and
is considered very familiar in some European countries [4,5]. Current
methodologies used for cupping therapy differ according to the type
of cupping therapy e.g. dry cupping method differs from medicinal
cupping method [6]. In this review article, we shed light on the two



methods of wet cupping therapy reported in the literature to discuss
which is more beneficial to be standardized in practicing cupping
therapy in treating so many diseases as we will mention later in this
article.


**History of cupping therapy**


Cupping therapy is being practiced nowadays in many countries all
over the world including Germany, Norway, Denmark, Saudi Arabia,
Egypt, India, China and other countries. German people are familiar
with cupping therapy [4] and so are Danish and Norwegian peoples
where those European societies already have a shift in attitude to
include complementary medicine within the conventional health care
system [5].


The exact origin of cupping therapy is a matter of controversy.
Chinese scientists report in their literature that cupping therapy is a

part of the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) dating back to at least
2,000 years [2].


In the middle east, Arabic writers report that cupping therapy
dates back to 3500 B.C. (5500 years ago), where Assyrians were the first
Arab population to use primitive tools as animal horns and bamboo
wood for cupping therapy then the Chinese physician, Jee Hong (381281 B.C.) was among the leaders in that art. Arabic civilization termed
cupping therapy, Al-hijamah therapy (which means in Arabic: to
restore to the original size), where it was used in treating hypertension,
polycythemia, headache, migraine and drug intoxication. They
diagnosed polycythemia whenever there was an exaggeration of the
pink color of the skin [7]. Interestingly, venesection (phlebotomy) is
still being used currently in hospitals for treating polycythemia, where
blood is drawn out and is replaced by saline infusion [8].


Ancient Egyptians were reported to practice cupping therapy
earlier than many old civilizations, where cupping therapy was one of
the oldest known medical therapies in ancient Egypt. The first report

of using cupping therapy in ancient Egypt dates back to 1550 B.C.

(more than 3500 years ago) where drawings on the famous Egyptian
papyrus paper (Ebers paper) and ancient Egyptian temples showed that
Egyptians were advanced in treatment using cupping therapy. Cupping
therapy was also used in ancient Greek medicine [9,10].


In 400 B.C., Herodotus (a Greek historian) recorded that the ancient

Egyptian physicians who recommended the application of sucking cups
to the body already used both wet cupping therapy and dry cupping
therapy. Diseases treated by cupping therapy included headache, lack
of appetite, maldigestion, fainting, abscess evacuation, narcolepsy
(repeated sleepy desires) and others [11].


In 3300 BC, in Ancient Macedonia, cupping therapy had been used
since prehistoric times to treat diseases and health disorders [12,13].


In the United States, there is a progressive increase in the use of
cupping therapy and other types of complementary medicine [14]. In
a recent report from Harvard medical school about pediatric patients
suffering from chronic severe pain, authors reported that cupping and
acupuncture treatment were pleasant and helpful for pain treatment

[15].


Currently, most widely used practice for cupping therapy is in
China. Cupping therapy is considered by Chinese to be part of the
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Chinese hospitals recognized
cupping therapy as a formal modality of treatment since 1950 [3].
Currently, medical practitioners in China and Mongolia are practicing
cupping therapy for treating hypertension, neck pain, headache,
chronic hepatitis, ophthalmic diseases, skin diseases and infectious
diseases [16].


Loukas et al. recently reported that knowledge gained from religious
texts (Qur’an and Hadeeth) may guide attention of researchers to start
research and get some benefits when comparing such knowledge
with modern medical knowledge. Prophetic medicine is the medical
knowledge gained from sayings, advices and teachings of Prophet
Mohammad peace be upon him, [17,18] which recommended many
lines of treatment as cupping therapy: (If there is a benefit in any of your
treatment modalities, benefit will be in the blade puncture in cupping
therapy, a gulp of honey and cauterizing, but I do not like cauterization)

[17,18].



**Cupping therapy is effective in treatment of incurable medical**
**conditions**


Cupping therapy was reported to treat medical conditions as herpes
zoster [19], vitiligo [20], hypertension [1,21,22], rheumatoid arthritis

[23,24], headache and migraine [13,25]. Cupping therapy was reported
to relieve pain of dysmenorrhoea [26], acute trigeminal neuralgia [27],
chronic osteoarthritis [10], carpal tunnel syndrome [4], fibrositis [28],
firomyalgia [6,29-31], cervical spondylosis, lumbar disc herniation [3],
brachialgia paraesthetica nocturna [32], chronic non-specific neck pain

[33-35], persistent non-specific low back pain [36] and pain of acute
gouty arthritis [37].

Wet cupping therapy (Al-hijamah) has solid scientific and medical
bases according to Taibah theory suggested by Salah M. El Sayed. Wet
cupping therapy is as an artificial surgical excretory procedure that
clears blood and interstitial fluids from CPS. It opens skin barrier,
enhances natural excretory functions of the skin, enhances immunity
and increases filtration at both capillary ends to clear blood from CPS
to restore physiology and homeostasis. Moreover, it was reported that
compression pressure exerted on the skin for more than few seconds
(as that exerted by the outline of sucking cups during Al-hijamah)
may benefit patients through the occurrence of reactive hyperemia
phenomenon. In this phenomenon, vascular compression causes
a decrease in blood supply to the skin for few minutes resulting in
accumulation of vasodilator chemicals. As soon as vascular compression
is removed, blood flow to skin dramatically increases, which is called
hyperemia [38]. This may bring more blood to the skin circulation to
be filtered and cleared during next steps of Al-hijamah.

Interestingly, Hany Salah was the first to report the best anatomical
sites in human body for doing cupping therapy in treating different
diseases [39].


As there are several methodologies to practice cupping therapy,
proper choice and selection of best methods of cupping therapy for
treating diseases seems mandatory.

Dry cupping therapy may be less beneficial than wet cupping
therapy due to lack of excretion of CPS in dry cupping therapy (Table
1). Wet cupping therapy needs proper discussion of its available
methodologies to optimize its therapeutic outcomes.


**Technical Methods Used for Performing Cupping**
**Therapy**

Before discussing the benefits or hazards of cupping therapy, it is
strongly advisable to know types of cupping therapy and to revise the
steps of wet cupping therapy to standardize the optimal protocol for
cupping therapy. Taking Chinese cupping therapy as an example, many
different types of cupping therapy are being practiced nowadays in
official Chinese hospitals [3,6] as summarized in table 2.


Concentrating on methods of wet cupping therapy is the aim of
this article. Although this issue is vital, it did not receive enough
attention when discussing the results of wet cupping treatment.
Interestingly, when we reviewed the cupping methodologies reported
in the literature, we found minor but important differences among the
methodologies used for wet cupping therapy. Two distinct wet cupping
methodologies were reported in the literature. Both methods are in
agreement with each other as regard the starting steps, which include
demarcation of skin points to which cupping therapy should be applied,
followed by sterilization at these sites and as regard the last step, which
is sterilization. They differ in the order and number of the steps of

cupping treatment itself i.e. what comes first: cupping step (negative
pressure suctioning) or puncturing skin step. The difference in the
two methods may reflect different historical origins in both methods
of cupping therapy based on the known standard protocols in their
countries of origin.


In a Korean review of literature for databases of cupping therapy
and also in a Korean study, wet cupping therapy was effective in treating
many disease conditions of variable etiologies and pathogeneses

[37,41]. Authors mentioned steps of wet cupping therapy exactly as it is
done in Chinese clinics in which the five steps of wet cupping therapy
are: demarcation (marking cupping points by pen), sterilization,
puncturing (lanceting skin in 2 mm-depth), cupping (with manual
pump suction for few minutes) and sterilization [19]. This method
is better to be abbreviated to PC (puncturing and cupping) method.
In another Chinese report for treating 140 cases of fibrositis [28] and
another Chinese study for treating gouty arthritis using wet cupping
therapy, the authors reported the same steps of the PC method [39].


In a German study for treating carpal tunnel syndrome with
wet cupping therapy, authors mentioned same steps reported by the
previous Chinese studies [4], which give the impression that German
physicians got their cupping method from Chinese medicine. Other
European peoples use mainly the PC method of wet cupping therapy

[2,5].

In the Arab literature, a different six-step method of wet
cupping therapy is reported in prophetic medicine which includes
an extra step (cupping step before skin puncturing) i.e. steps of



the Arabic methodology for wet cupping therapy (Al-hijamah) are
skin demarcation, sterilization, cupping, puncturing, cupping and
sterilization [41]. This method is better to be abbreviated to CPC
(cupping, puncturing and cupping) method. Interestingly, a Chinese
report described steps of the currently practiced wet cupping therapy
method in Saudi Arabia [42], which is exactly the CPC method as
reviewed early in prophetic medicine [41]. Same CPC method was
reported by a research group from Iran in a recent article describing
cardio protective effects of cupping therapy in experimental animals

[43].


Recently, the same CPC method was reported in an Iraqi report,
where CPC method of cupping therapy was quite a safe procedure
in treating a variety of diseases e.g. back pain, sciatica, joint pain,
hypertension, polycythemia and other diseases with reversible skin
changes with no side effects [44]. CPC method was also reported also
by an Egyptian research group who reported a high beneficial effect
of wet cupping therapy in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [23]. CPC
method was reported to treat hypertension by another Iraqi research
group [1]. Same CPC method was reported in a study to treat headache
and migraine by a research group from Iran [13]. In a study about
cupping therapy done recently in Pakistan, authors investigated the
differences between venous blood and blood that comes out during
wet cupping therapy. Authors practiced CPC method of wet cupping
therapy [45]. This may give the impression that the historical root of
CPC method in wet cupping therapy may be of an Arabic origin.

The most important question that arises soon is which methodology

may carry better therapeutic outcomes for wet cupping therapy: PC
method or CPC method.


Proper answering of this question needs prior understanding of
the differences and expected sequences of events of both treatment
methods of wet cupping therapy.


**Evidence-based Analysis of Detailed Steps and Events of**
**Wet Cupping Therapy (CPC Method Versus PC Method)**

Differences between PC and CPC methods of wet cupping
therapy can be of therapeutic importance and studying them may
help in standardizing wet cupping therapy (Table 3). Based on our
understanding to how wet cupping therapy works, evidence-based
steps of wet cupping therapy (CPC method versus PC method) can be
analyzed in the next points.


**Before application of wet cupping therapy**

1- Tissue fluids filtered from the capillary walls cross the interstitial
spaces between parenchymal cells to gain access to the lymphatic



capillaries to return to the vascular system [46]. Metabolic byproducts

[47] and endogenous free radicals [48] may be continuously formed
inside cells and excreted into the interstitial fluids in interstitial
spaces. Interstitial fluid is in continuous exchange with intravascular
fluid compartment (Figure 1A). The exchange process mainly occurs
downstream of arterioles in capillaries and postcapillary venules [49].
Based on that, in physiological conditions, cupping therapy may have
a preventive benefit through clearing interstitial spaces from any
metabolic waste products, free radicals or xenobiotics in interstitial
fluids.

2- In pathological conditions, localization of pro-inflammatory
substances [50], inflammatory cells [51], toxins, bacteria and harmful
biological or chemical substances [52,53] tends to occur at specific sites
that differ according to disease type and pathological stage (Figure 1B).
At sites of localization, cupping therapy can be applied to facilitate
drainage and removal of the CPS and to decrease the excess fluid volume
and hence the pressure exerted by interstitial fluids in interstitial spaces.

3- Factors determining the composition of interstitial fluid and

edema in burns and in the induction of initial swelling in inflammation

[61]. Based on that, pain conditions may benefit from cupping therapy
through excretion of fluids containing the above-mentioned CPS
(Figure 2).


6-Nerve endings (nociceptors that transmit pain signals) become
sensitized during tissue damage or inflammation. Goodwin gave
the term inflammatory soup to the mixture of inflammatory cells as
macrophages and lymphocytes together with chemical mediators
e.g. substance P histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, prostaglandins
and cytokines (Figure 2) in the peripheral tissues, that increase in
the responsiveness of A delta and C nerve fibres, which conduct pain
signals at different rates [62].


7- Excretory functions of the skin depend on its histological
structure and its large surface area. Skin excretes many drugs, heavy
metals, chemicals and endogenous toxic compounds. Skin has a
drug metabolizing function [63], drug biotransformation function

[64], antioxidant function [65] in addition to the excretory functions
exerted by skin appendages e.g. sweat glands [66-69]. Skin barrier
retards excretion of accumulated toxins, while skin injury disturbs
skin excretory functions [70] with retention of drugs and endogenous
metabolites [71-73]. Based on that, cupping therapy is so beneficial as it
opens skin barrier and enhances skin excretory role.















subsequently the interstitial pressure include the plasma composition,
the balance of Starling forces across the capillary wall (principally
capillary hydrostatic pressure and plasma protein osmotic pressure),
capillary permeability, surface area of capillary endothelium, lymph
transport, and the physicochemical properties of the interstitial space
matrix. Also, modification, addition or removal of components by
peripheral cell metabolism can determine the composition of interstitial
fluids [54]. Based on that, cupping therapy may be beneficial in clearing
interstitial fluids and restoring normal physiology of interstitial spaces.


4- Pathogenesis of pain includes interstitial hypertension and
increased amount of neurotransmitters, such as substance P and its
receptor, calcitonin gene-related peptide and other neurotransmitters
in afferent nerves [55]. Based on that, cupping therapy at these localized
sites may remove localized fluids, clear interstitial spaces, decrease
interstitial hypertension and excrete CPS.


5- Substance P is an 11-amino acid peptide that is widely distributed
in the nervous system of human and animal species. Substance P is
functionally linked to pain [56]. Substance P releases histamine [57]
leading to increased cutaneous capillary permeability without any fluid
leakage through intact skin barrier. Substance P induces release of
antigen-evoked mediators [58], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [59] and
leukotrienes [60], which act as inflammatory mediators to enhance pain
and tissue swelling. The interstitium plays a role in the development of

8- Interstitial fluid is continuously filtered at arterial end of
capillaries (net filtration pressure=-13 mm Hg that shifts tissue fluids
to the outside of capillaries) [74] and is absorbed at venous end of
capillaries (net absorption pressure=+7 mmHg (Figure 1A) that shifts
tissue fluids to the inside of capillaries) 5]. Based on that, external
suction pressure (as that occurring in cupping therapy) may enhance
the excretion of tissue fluids filled with noxious substances.


**1** **[st]** **step of wet cupping therapy (1** **[st]** **cupping)**


(In the CPC method only not in the PC method)


1- Skin has a viscoelastic nature, which helps it to be sucked to
the inside of cups [75]. When first vacuum pressure is applied during
cupping therapy (Figure 3A); negative suction pressure collects



interstitial fluids in the cupped area causing uplifting of the skin inside
cups without any fluid leakage through skin (skin barrier) as intact skin
prevents extrusion of tissue fluids (Figure 3B) to outside due to high
content of dermal matrix substances (dermatan sulfate, hyaluronic
acid and chondroitin sulfate), which constitute the ground substance
surrounding the dermal fibrous components that contribute to the
viscoelastic nature of the skin. Dermis is strong and elastic due to its
high content of elastin protein (makes skin soft and elastic and helps
skin sucking inside cups) and collagen protein (gives strength to skin)

[76,77]. Collected fluids intervene between skin and subcutaneous
tissues. This may help breaking connective tissue adhesions. Based on
that, skin surface is very suitable for practicing cupping therapy for
clearing tissue fluids and capillary fluids.

2- Increase in size of skin uplifting inside cups may decrease local
pressure inside skin upliftings around blood capillaries (Boyle’s law)

[78] leading to filtration of more fluids inside skin upliftings (Figure
3C). Based on that, 1 [st] cupping step in CPC method is very helpful in
clearing capillary blood from excess fluids with wastes (via filtration
through capillary pores in the local cupped area) as a preparatory step
for further capillary blood clearance.

3- With progressive increase in size of skin upliftings, corresponding
decrease in pressure occurs inside skin uplifting (Boyle’s law) [78]
around capillaries leading to more fluid (may contain hemolyzed blood
cells but not intact blood cells) filtration from blood capillaries causing
more dilution of the inflammatory mediators (Figures 3C and 3D). This
may help breaking more connective tissue adhesions with a possible
relief of tension muscular spasm. Based on that, all those constitute the
scientific rationale of dry cupping therapy.

4- At first, the high negative pressure of cupping therapy sucks more

skin inside cups causing a more increase in the size of skin upliftings
with a corresponding decrease in the pressure inside skin upliftings
(till values near that of the capillary venous hydrostatic pressure). This
decreases progressively the absorption at the venous end of capillaries
(Figures 3C-3E). Movement of filtered fluids towards skin upliftings
away from capillaries adds a more decrease to absorption at the venous
end of capillaries. Based on that, most of the tissue fluids containing
CPS are not absorbed again to venous end of capillary circulation due
to effect of cupping therapy.

5- Accumulation of fluids (tissue fluids+filtered fluids+hemolyzed



blood cells+filtered soluble substances) containing wastes and
hemolyzed blood cells in uplifted cupped skin area may cause dilution
and local redistribution of nociceptive mediators (Figures 3C-3E).
Nociceptive mediators e.g. substance P (neuropeptide released
from nerve endings related to pain), inflammatory mediators and
prostaglandins (present in interstitial fluids at local inflammatory sites
or come with filtered fluids) are diluted in the locally accumulating
tissue fluids in the uplifted area due to the effect of cupping-induced
negative suction pressure. This may take substance P away from pain
receptors and pain sensitive structures producing analgesic effect
(Figures 2 and 3).

6- Dilution of the inflammatory mediators may occur with
temporary accumulation of interstitial fluids and filtered fluids beneath
skin surface and around nerve endings (Figures 3C-3E). This may bathe
nerve endings in collected fluids and reduce their stimulation [79].
This may decrease neurotransmission of pain sensation producing an
analgesic effect. Analgesic effect of cupping therapy helps in decreasing
pain sensation during subsequent superficial skin laceration step. Based

on that, 1 cupping step in CPC method (not in PC method) has a st

strong analgesic effect, which allows doing subsequent skin puncturing
with no need for analgesic or anesthetic administration.

7- After removal of sucking cups, immediate decrease in size of skin
upliftings occurs due to removal of negative pressure until reaching
level of collected fluids (Figure 3F). If skin upliftings are left for some
time without skin puncturing (dry cupping therapy), fluid collections
inside upliftings will leak and redistribute to underlying tissues causing
disappearance of skin upliftings. Improvement of pain instead of
retention of inflammatory mediators and noxious substances may be
due to dilution of those CPS and their redistribution to new sites away
from pain receptors and pain sensitive structures after disappearance
of skin upliftings. In addition, skin puncturing allows release of
endogenous opioids e.g. endorphins, encephalins and dynorphins that
decrease pain sensation [80] and intensify cupping therapy-induced
analgesic effect. Derivatives of proopiomelanocortin e.g. β-endorphin
and melanocortin hormones can block inflammatory reactions [80].
Based on that, CPC method of wet cupping therapy is better than
dry cupping therapy and PC method in treating pain as CPC method
includes 2 advantages: advantage of dry cupping therapy (1 [st] part of the
CPC method) and release of endogenous opioids, while PC method has
only one advantage through release of endogenous opioids. In the CPC
method, better efficient excretion of CPS occurs.


8- Blood capillaries in the cupped area may undergo compression
due to pressure on their walls from outside by the accumulated collected
fluids. This increases capillary hydrostatic pressure leading to more
capillary filtration and consequently more blood clearance. The longer
the duration of cupping (for few minutes), the more accumulation of
tissue fluid in the skin layers inside the cups (around skin capillaries)
until an equilibrium point is reached at which no further fluid will
accumulate. Escape and redistribution of fluids from skin uplift back to
nearby tissues is prevented by maintained negative pressure during first
cupping (for few minutes). Removal of negative pressure of cupping
(through removing cups) prevents more accumulation of tissue fluid
and instead, allows for slow fluid redistribution. Immediate skin
pricking for few millimeters depth is recommended to prevent fluid
redistribution and to get better cupping results.


9- Compression pressure exerted on the skin by the outline of
sucking cups during the CPC method for few minutes may capture
capillary blood in the cupped area (for filtration) and may induce
reactive hyperemia phenomenon at the sites of cups application. In

this phenomenon, compression causes a reduction in blood flow to
the skin for few minutes resulting in accumulation of metabolites and
vasodilator chemicals. At the end of this step, vascular compression
is removed causing a dramatic increase in blood flow to the skin
known as reactive hyperemia, which may bring more blood to the skin
circulation to be filtered and cleared during next steps of Al-hijamah
(CPC method).


**C- 2** **[nd]** **step of wet cupping therapy (skin puncturing) (In both**
**CPC and PC method)**


1- Injury to skin (as in puncturing step in cupping therapy) causes
a double phenomenon capillary reaction. In the first phenomenon,
capillary permeability immediately increases for less than 10 minutes
(Figure 4). In the second phenomenon, a delayed increase in
permeability begins (Figure 4) about one hour after injury [81,82].
Antihistamines affect the first phenomenon but not the second one

[81,82]. Increased capillary permeability in the first phenomenon is so
helpful to enhance capillary filtration, blood clearance of intravascular
fluids and fluid collection then movement of collected fluids towards
skin puncture site to be excreted under effect of cupping therapy.
Practically, this 10 minutes period is consumed in the second cupping
step in the CPC method [7] and in creating skin upliftings then cupping



step in the PC method [36]. Based on that, CPC method of wet cupping
therapy makes better benefit of increased capillary permeability during
this 10 minutes period and filters capillary blood during the whole
period, while PC method consumes this time to create skin upliftings
then collect fluids. CPC method may be more beneficial in blood
clearance than PC method.


2- In the CPC method, collected fluids after first cupping step are
retained just beneath skin surface and are ready to get out when skin
is punctured (Figure 5A), while nothing is collected in PC method.
Injuring skin causes opening of skin barrier and a traumatic injury to
capillaries leading to bleeding in both cupping methods.

3- Increased interstitial fluid pressure may cause pain due to nerve
compression [83]. Based on that, in the CPC method, puncturing skin
is less painful due to collection of fluids (interstitial fluids and filtered
fluids) beneath the skin surface leading to decreased interstitial fluid
pressure, which decreases pain sensation. In addition, there is dilution
and redistribution of the noxious agents, inflammatory mediators and
CPS away from pain receptors and pain sensitive structures (Figure 2),
while this is not the case in the PC method. In the PC method, pricking
skin may be painful at the tender points beneath which pain-causing
substances are existing. In addition, localization of inflammation at
certain sites produces local erythema and tenderness at these sites,
which makes direct skin puncturing painful as in the PC method.

4- In the CPC method, collected fluids are nearer to skin surface
than blood in blood capillaries (Figures 5A and 5B). Blood from injured
capillaries becomes mixed with collected fluids (interstitial fluids and
filtered fluids) beneath skin surface and starts to come out mixed with
the collected fluids i.e. altered blood that comes out through superficial
skin lacerations induced during wet cupping therapy is a mixture of
extruded collected fluids and bloodshed at traumatic capillaries. In the
PC method, fresh blood comes out rapidly as there is no prior collection
of fluids to slow down its flow. Little tissue fluids are mixed with blood,
as there is no filtered fluid from capillaries or collected interstitial
fluids until this step in the PC method i.e. there is no blood clearance
effect until now in the PC method (Figures 5A and 5B). The noxious
substances that are present in the interstitial fluids are still present and
not excreted in the PC method (as noxious substances are not collected
or diluted in fluids inside skin uplifting in the PC method).


5- Injury to vessel wall (as that in the puncturing step of cupping
therapy) stimulates hemostatic mechanisms of blood coagulation

(both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways). This leads to vasoconstriction,
platelet plug formation (to seal the bleeding site), formation of fibrin
thrombus and activation of fibrinolytic system to prevent extension of
the thrombus soon occurs. Damaged endothelial cells releases tissue
thromboplastin, which activates the extrinsic pathway of coagulation.
Exposure of subendothelial collagen stimulates platelet adhesion and
aggregation, activates factor XII (intrinsic pathway of coagulation) and
activates fibrinolysis. Platelets soon aggregate to form a platelet plug.
In addition, platelets release ADP (increases platelet release reactions),
thromboxane A2 (vasoconstrictor), phospholipids (platelet factor 3
that is essential for coagulation) and platelet factor 4 that has a local
anti-heparin effect and is essential for coagulation [84]. Based on that,

it is essential to start 2 [nd] cupping (suction) step immediately after skin

skin puncturing in both CPC and PC methods. In addition, on proper
practice of cupping therapy, collected fluids are excreted with minor
blood loss.


6- The initiation of coagulation is caused by activation of factor
VII through binding of tissue factor (a cell membrane protein). This
activates formation of thrombin, which converts soluble fibrinogen to
insoluble fibrin threads. Exposed sub-endothelial collagen together
with thrombin stimulate platelet aggregation and coagulation cascade

[85]. Based on that, proper practice of cupping therapy carries no risk
of bleeding or serious hemorrhage.


7- In the CPC method, blood coming up from injured capillaries
towards puncture site at the skin surface is facing some collected
fluids (Figures 5A and 5B), which may hinder bleeding and enhance
coagulation [86]. In PC method, the opposite occurs and blood comes
out directly as it does not meet prior collected fluids.


8- Bloodshed during cupping therapy is of capillary origin (based
on the superficial nature of skin lacerations during cupping therapy)
(Figures 5A and 5B). Depth of skin puncturing in cupping therapy
is few millimeters [36] unless a superficial vein is injured (cupping
malpractice). Based on that, capillary bloodshed during cupping
therapy may help in improving capillary microcirculation, draining
metabolic byproducts and relieving degree of congestion in congested
capillaries.


**D- 3** **[rd]** **step of wet cupping therapy (2** **[nd]** **cupping)**


1- In the CPC method, when second vacuum pressure is applied
during cupping therapy (negative suction pressure=suction force),
collected fluids are mixed with blood inside skin uplifting then the
mixture is sucked to outside the skin. Contact of blood with collected
tissue fluids (just beneath skin) surface may slow down the speed of
blood flow and may stimulate the coagulation pathway (Figures 5A and
5B) and allow time for thrombin formation [86]. Filtered fluids then
replace extruded fluids soon in the interstitial spaces then become
excreted. In the PC method, application of second vacuum pressure
sucks traumatic blood and enhances bleeding as vacuum pressure
removes blood rapidly, removes formed clots and hinders thrombus
formation. Lack of prior collection of tissue fluids and filtered fluids in
the PC method does not slow down the speed of blood flow (Figures
6A-6D). Blood loss in this cupping step may be much more in the PC
method than in the CPC method of wet cupping therapy (PC has a high
blood letting effect).


2- In the PC method, puncture sites are usually tapped to draw
blood out [6]. In the CPC method, 2 [nd] cupping suctioning is enough
to excrete collected fluids inside skin uplifting (no need for tapping
puncture sites) (Figures 6A-6D).



3- When second vacuum pressure is applied during cupping
therapy, traction forces lead to increased capillary permeability.
Observations of Shirley et al. that intravenous infusion of albumin
caused capillary distension and increases maximally the porosity of the
capillaries led to the conclusion that capillary pores can be stretched
i.e. capillary pores are not rigid structures [87]. Based on that, negative
pressure suctioning in cupping therapy may stretch capillary pores and
enhance fluid filtration and capillary blood clearance especially during

the 1 [st] capillary reaction to skin puncturing (about 10 minutes) [81,82].


4- In the CPC method, when second vacuum pressure is applied
during cupping therapy; negative suction pressure (suction force and

filtration force) is transmitted through skin punctures to be added to
the capillary hydrostatic pressure (filtration force) leading to increased
fluid filtration from intravascular spaces at arterial end of capillaries to
interstitial spaces and increased formation of tissue fluids (causing more
clearance of blood inside capillaries) that causes more skin uplifting. In
the PC method, tissue adhesions, bleeding and interstitial fluids may
partially antagonize the transmission of negative pressure from inside
cups to around capillaries (Figures 6A-6D). This may decrease filtration
force at skin capillaries (decreased blood clearance).

5- In the CPC method, skin uplifting is already formed before
puncture step. So, when second vacuum pressure is applied during
cupping therapy (for 10 minutes) (Figure 4); continuously filtered
fluids (mixed with some traumatic blood) inside skin uplifting is
continuously removed (high blood clearance effect) during this whole



time period (about 10 minutes). Continuous evacuation then filling of
the skin upliftings using filtered capillary fluids makes better use of the

1 [st] part of the capillary reaction phenomenon mentioned previously

[83,84] in enhancing clearance of capillary fluids. In the PC method,
skin upliftings are formed during this step (suction step) and need time
to form. Skin upliftings formed in the PC method contain blood, tissue
fluids and filtered fluids. Based on that, CPC method clears blood better
than the PC method (Figures 6A-6D) as CPC method collects fluids
(only fluids without blood) before skin puncturing step and collects
fluids (mixed with blood) again after skin puncturing.

6- The last part of cupping step time in the PC method (less than
10 minutes) is consumed in the evacuation of the skin upliftings then
filling of the skin upliftings using filtered capillary fluids. This decreases
capillary blood clearance effect in the PC method (Figures 6B-6D).

7- In the CPC method, the contents of skin upliftings that are
formed before skin puncture step are collected fluids (filtered fluids with
soluble substances+interstitial fluids+hemolyzed RBCs+fragmented
WBCs+fragmented platelets+CPS) (Figure 3). Intact blood cells (RBCs,
WBCs and platelets) are unable to pass through capillary pores. Intact
blood cells have sizes in micrometer range [88], which cannot cross
pores of fenestrated capillaries of the skin (having sizes in nanometer
range, 6-12 nm) [89]. This bathes interstitial spaces with filtered fluids,
which take their way towards skin upliftings (Figures 6C and 6D). This
helps dilution and redistribution of CPS in collected fluids. After skin

puncturing step and sucking fluid inside skin upliftings during 2 [nd]

cupping step, new filtered fluids plus blood from traumatized capillaries
are collected inside skin upliftings (Figures 6A-6D). In the PC method,
fluid collection starts after skin puncture and cupping application
to create skin upliftings. This bathes interstitial spaces with fresh
traumatic blood, which take its way towards skin upliftings (Figures
6A-6D). Based on that, CPC method induces better clearance effect of
tissue spaces and blood capillaries than the PC method.


8- Traction forces exerted on fenestrated capillaries (due to strong
persistent negative suction pressure) applied at the skin may increase
suction forcibly against their fenestral pore sizes allowing for more
filtration of fluid with soluble crystalloid (small particle sizes) and colloid
substances (large particle sizes as plasma proteins) e.g. β-lipoprotein
(Molecular weight: 1,300,000) and large molecules can pass through
skin capillaries into the tissue fluid [81,82,90-92] then cupping therapy
opens skin barrier and enhances natural excretory role of skin. It is
worth noting that a large molecule as β -lipoprotein and globulins

cannot be filtered through renal glomeruli, as their molecular weight is
too large to be filtered. Under physiological conditions, plasma albumin
and globulin (high molecular weight proteins) cannot pass through the
filtration membrane as their molecular size and negative charge act as
barriers that prevent their passage through the glomerular capillary
filtration membrane. Opposite to that, low molecular weight proteins
as β2-microglobulin, α1-microglobulin, and lysozyme can freely pass
through the filtration membrane. Majority of these proteins (95%) are
reabsorbed when entering the proximal convoluted tubule although the
filtration amount is low [93]. Based on that, cupping therapy facilitates
clearing of blood from CPS by increasing skin excretory functions
(Figures 6A-6D). This clears blood from more metabolic byproducts,
endogenous waste, exogenous toxic materials soluble in interstitial
fluids and also clears materials deposited in the interstitial spaces.


9- Cupping therapy pressure is a negative pressure force (suction
force=filtration force) and was reported to range from (-200 to -560
hPa, hecta Pascal) [94], which is equivalent to (-150 to -420) mmHg
(Figures 6A-6D) and drives fluids to move from intravascular
compartment to the outside of capillaries). Net filtration pressure at
arterial end of capillaries=-13 mmHg that shifts tissue fluids to the
outside of capillaries, while net absorption pressure at venous end of
capillaries=+7 mm Hg (Figures 1A and 6E) that shifts tissue fluids
to the inside of capillaries [74]. Based on that, when adding suction
pressure of cupping therapy, calculated net filtration pressure at arterial
end of capillaries is -163 to -433 mmHg to the outside of capillaries,
while calculated net filtration pressure at venous end of capillaries
is -143 to -413 mm Hg to the outside of capillaries (Figures 6B and
6C). Therefore, both capillary ends (arterial end and venous end) filter
their fluids due to high-pressure gradient across blood capillaries i.e.
(Negative suction pressure+capillary hydrostatic pressure inside blood
capillaries)>(osmotic pressure of capillaries at either ends).

10- At first, transmitted high negative pressure of cupping therapy
in the CPC method (from inside cups through skin punctures to around
skin capillaries) decreases absorption at venous end of capillaries then



stops it and finally fluid filtration occurs at venous end of capillaries
(opposite of physiological state). More fluid filtration occurs at arterial
end of capillaries (exaggeration of physiological state). This is expected
to decrease capillary venous return, capillary venous pressure, pressure
in larger veins and peripheral vascular resistance. This is also expected
to remove blood congestion and enhance blood flow velocity. In the PC
method, all that occurs to a lower extent as lower fluid filtration occurs
(Figures 3 and 6).


11- Decreased intravascular volume inside blood capillaries in
the cupped area (due to fluid filtration and traumatic capillary blood
loss) together with the negative suction pressure (induced by cupping)
collectively may cause a decrease in hydrostatic pressure inside blood
capillaries in cupped area, which may mobilize more blood to local
capillaries in the cupped area i.e. enhances capillary microcirculation
and circulates more blood for clearance through cupping therapy.

12- Suction of interstitial tissue fluids induced by negative vacuum
suction may mobilize interstitial tissue fluids in nearby areas to drain
in and refill the interstitial spaces in the cupped area. The continuously
applied negative pressure for few minutes in the cupped area may
facilitate such mobilization. Drainage of that fluid through cupping
lacerations allows continuation of the process and better clearance of
stagnant interstitial fluids (Figures 6A-6D).


13- CPC method may be better than the PC method in resolving
congested blood. Congested blood is altered in color and contains
accumulated cellular waste products, inflammatory mediators and
toxins. During the CPC method of wet cupping therapy, congested
blood loses its fluids and wastes through filtration. This resolves major
part of congestion (Figures 6A-6E). Then, blood comes out immediately
after skin puncturing when second cupping step (negative suctioning)
is applied to this local area. Its excretion becomes easier (less viscosity)
when it is mixed with collected fluids (continuously filtered fluids
and tissue fluids). In the PC method, no filtration step occurs before
puncturing skin, which does not excrete extra fluids from congested
blood. Suction effect stimulates more fresh blood to come from the

site of trauma. Lack of previously collected fluids in the PC method
allows traumatic blood to move rapidly to outside with little filtered
fluids and tissue fluids, while viscosity of congested blood may delay its
movement in interstitial spaces in its way to skin puncture site i.e. low
blood clearance effect in the PC method.


14- Ecchymosis (large hemorrhagic areas about 2 cm in diameter
causing purple discoloration which do not blanch on pressure) [95]
occurs after cupping therapy and is traumatic in origin and not due
to thrombocytopenia. It is different from ecchymosis occurring in
thrombocytopenia (Table 4). Bathing the interstitial spaces and the
inside of skin upliftings with blood, (more in the PC method than in
the CPC method) is the main cause of this ecchymosis.


15- In the CPC method of wet cupping therapy, waste products
to be drained in lymphatic capillaries (in addition to some amount of
lymph) may be a constituent of the fluid that will be drained through
skin incisions to outside under effect of suction pressure. This removes
difficulties in lymphatic drainage and improves lymphatic circulation.
In the PC method, collected fluids may be lower as skin upliftings form
late in the CPC method (Figures 6A-6D).

16- Suction of interstitial tissue fluids induced by continuous
negative vacuum suction may increase capillary permeability (due
to traction forces induced by suction) and may filter more fluids
(containing crystalloids and colloids at both arterial and venous ends
of capillaries) from blood capillaries to the interstitial spaces. Emptying
interstitial spaces due to negative pressure of cupping therapy stimulates
more filtration of capillary blood leading to more blood clearance.
Continuous excretion through skin lacerations in cupped area allows
this process to continue leading to blood clearance (Figure 6D). In the
CPC method, a mixture of blood and collected fluids are escaping at
the same time at the incision points, which may have a squeezing effect
upon traumatized capillaries at the points of traumatic punctures. In
the PC method, tissue fluid accumulation occurs slowly, while opened
capillaries are bleeding and the amount of bleeding increases by the
effect of negative pressure.

17- Cupping-induced increase in capillary blood flow may
stimulate more blood flow to cupped area causing more fluid filtration
then excretion through skin incisions. This may help improving the
systemic and local circulations, improving tissue perfusion, improving
cellular oxygenation, improving venous drainage and improving blood
clearance.


18- Haemostatic mechanisms (in intact blood vascular system)
tend to stop bleeding at injured sites in the cupped area within about
4-8 minutes (normal bleeding time) that ends before session of cupping
suction finishes (average 10 minutes). This may minimize blood loss
and may allow better filtration and drainage of tissue fluids. Based on
that, in the CPC method, blood coagulation may occur earlier than
that in the PC method as contact of blood with tissue fluids facilitates
coagulation [86]. This occurs in the CPC method. Also, closure of skin
barrier due to formation of blood clots at skin puncture sites (at end of
bleeding time) is a mechanical termination of wet cupping therapy at
which no further excretion occurs and stopping 2 [nd] cupping step should
be done (Figure 6D).

**E- After the end of cupping therapy**


1- Removal of the CPS and blood congestion may immediately
clear the underlying cause of local inflammation, tenderness and pain
(similar to medical principle of abscess evacuation). This may improve
the underlying muscle contraction without painful spasm. All that



may explain cupping-induced analgesia. Drainage of congested blood
improves local blood circulation and lymphatic circulation in this area
(Figure 6E).

2- Drainage of interstitial fluids and filtered fluids through skin
lacerations removes them and decreases absorption of these fluid and
their wastes through venous end of capillaries.

3- After finishing session of cupping therapy, new clear tissue fluid
gradually forms by filtration of capillary fluids (Figure 6E).


4- Enhancement of lymphatic circulation occurs due to lymph
drainage into larger lymph vessels and prevention of flow reversal due
to the presence of lymphatic valves.


5- Excretion via wet cupping therapy is multifactorial in origin. It
is selective for small particles having sizes less than or equal to capillary
fenestral sizes taking into account also pressure factor, time factor and
number of cups used for cupping therapy i.e. size-dependent, pressuredependent and time-dependent.

6-Ecchymosis disappears within few days and all side effects of
cupping are reversible [96,97].

7-Clearance efficiency of blood and interstitial fluids is better
after practicing the CPC method than after practicing the PC method
(Figure 6E).


**Prophetic Medicine Recommends CPC Method of Wet Cupping**
**Therapy (Al-Hijamah)**

The pioneering review article by Loukas et al. recently reported
that knowledge gained from religious texts (Qur’an and Hadeeth) is
in line with modern medical knowledge. In Islam, Qur’an is the direct
spoken words of God, while Hadeeth is the spoken words of Prophet
Mohammad peace be upon him [17].


Prophetic medicine is a term given to all the sayings (hadeeth),
advices, habits and teachings of Prophet Mohammad peace be upon
him as regard health and dealing with diseases. It was reported that in
prophetic medicine, cupping therapy is a highly recommended line of
