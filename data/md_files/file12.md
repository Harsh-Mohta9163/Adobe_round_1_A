**For the Bailey's Buttercream:** Place the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the
paddle attachment. Beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.
Gradually add the powdered sugar until it is all incorporated. Mix in the vanilla and Bailey's until
smooth. Add more Bailey's if necessary until the frosting has reached a good consistency for
piping or spreading. Frost the cupcakes as desired.

**Yield: 24 cupcakes**
